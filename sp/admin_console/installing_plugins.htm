<h3><a href="using_cluster_support_plugin.htm">Cluster Support</a></h3>
<p>This plug-in provides support for group administration of multiple containers via a single <em>Administration Console</em>. The clustering feature is based on the idea of a <em>Master</em> node and a set of <em>Slave</em> nodes that all share a common set of feature bundles and configuration. When the clustering feature is installed, any Container Instance may be configured as either a Master or Slave. All Slaves will periodically synchronize their state with the Master node. If the Master node becomes unavailable for any reason, the slaves will remain in their last configured state.</p>

After the feature is installed, all key management tasks performed using the <em>Manage PKI Keys Wizard</em> for each identity (service, organization, container, or user) will be stored in the designated external keystore.</p>
