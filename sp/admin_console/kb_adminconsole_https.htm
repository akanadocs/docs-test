<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>You can set up HTTPS access to the Akana Administration Console by enabling an HTTPS port.</p>
<p>There is just one step:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Adding an HTTPS listener to the applicable system.properties file</strong>: Go to the {release_directory}/instances/{containername} folder, open the system.properties file, and add an HTTPS listener.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes on Configuring an HTTPS Listener</h4>
<p>Several important points to note on configuring an HTTPS listener:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you add an HTTPS listener to the <strong>system.properties</strong> file (as described in the following scenarios) <em>before</em> you install the Policy Manager features, the HTTPS listener will be registered automatically in the database when you install the Policy Manager features and the listener will be present in the <strong>Containers</strong> section of the Policy Manager Management Console. </li>
	<li>If you add an HTTPS listener to the <strong>system.properties</strong> file <em>after</em> you install the Policy Manager features, the HTTPS listener will not registered automatically in the database and you will need to add an HTTPS listener using the <strong>Add Container Listener</strong> function in the Policy Manager <strong>Containers</strong> section in order to update the container metadata. Note that the HTTPS listener configuration should have <strong>Bind to all interfaces</strong> checked, and you can optionally choose to clone services hosted on other listeners. You must also generate a certificate for the listener after it is defined using the <strong>Manage PKI Keys</strong> option. See screen examples below. </li>
	<li>If you add a UI-Browsing listener to the <strong>system.properties</strong> file, Policy Manager gets the listener information from this file. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the HTTPS configuration process to get you started.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Add HTTPS Listener</h4>
<p>To enable an HTTPS listener, you must update the <strong>system.properties</strong> file in the {release_directory}/instances/{containername} folder, as shown below. Load the <strong>system.properties</strong> file into an editor and configure it based on the following Akana Administration Console access scenario. In this example, we use port 9446.</p>
<p><img src="images/ac_folder_system_properties.png" alt="Akana Administration Console folder structure: location of system.properties file" /></p>
<p>With the settings below, access to the Akana Administration Console is limited to the specified HTTPS listener.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <span class="apidoc_red">You must also delete the HTTP listener defined in the Policy Manager Management Console</span>.</p>

<h4>To modify the system.properties file to enable an HTTPS listener</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Open the <strong>{release_directory}/instances/{containername}/system.properties</strong> file in a text editor.</li>
	<li>Remove the following settings:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>org.osgi.service.http.port=9000</strong></li>
			<li><strong>com.soa.http.bind.all=true</strong></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	
	<li>Add the following settings:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>org.osgi.service.http.port.secure=9446</strong></li>
			<li><strong>com.soa.http.bind.all.secure=true</strong></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	
	<li>
		Save changes.</li>
	<li>Restart the container. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Step 2: Configure HTTPS Access to Akana Administration Console</h4>
<p>If you want access to the Akana Administration Console via HTTPS, you must add a new configuration category. You can do this manually by adding a .cfg file to the \{release_directory}\instances\{containername}\deploy folder.</p>

<h4>Add Configuration Category file</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Create a new file in the \{release_directory} folder and call it:
		<p><strong>com.soa.admin.console.cfg</strong></p></li>
	<li>Add the following line to the file:
		<p><strong>admin.console.access.restricted=true</strong>.</p></li>
	<li>Copy the file to the \deploy folder as illustrated below:
		<p><img src="images/kb_adminconsole_https_admin_console_config.jpg" alt="Putting the new Configuration Category file in the deploy folder" /></p></li>
	<li>Restart the container.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 3: Optional configuration to restrict Akana Administration Console access to ports defined in the system.properties file</h4>
<p>When the container is up and running, launch the Akana Administration Console (<strong>https://localhost:{port}/admin/</strong>). It should only be accessible on the port you defined in Step 1, and should comply with the rules for the configuration category you defined, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>admin.console.access.restricted=true</strong>: You can access the Akana Administration Console only through the port defined only in the <strong>system.properties</strong> file.</p>
<p>The default value for this property is <strong>false</strong>: If set to <strong>false</strong>, you can access the Akana Administration Console through the port defined in the system.properties file and also through the listeners defined in the Policy Manager workbench (see <a href="../../ag/listeners/about_listeners.htm">About Listeners</a> in the Policy Manager help).</p>
<h4>com.soa.admin.console.cfg enabled (True)</h4>
<ul>
	<li>You can only access the Akana Administration Console through the HTTPS port defined in the <strong>system.properties</strong> file. </li>
	<li>If you try to access Akana Administration Console using the default HTTP port, the response will be a 404 error.</li>
</ul>

<h4>com.soa.admin.console.cfg enabled (False)</h4>
<ul>
	<li>You can access the Akana Administration Console through the HTTPS port.

</ul>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If everything appears to be configured correctly and you are still seeing 404 errors when you try to launch the Akana Administration Console, review the following steps to attempt to troubleshoot the problem.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Inspect Log</h4>
<p>Inspect the container logs in {release_directory}\instances\{instance name}\logs and search for the following errors which occur near the startup:</p>
<pre>Caused by: java.net.BindException: Address already in use
  at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketBind(Native Method)
  at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.bind(Unknown Source)
  at java.net.ServerSocket.bind(Unknown Source)
  at java.net.ServerSocket.&lt;init&gt;(Unknown Source)</pre>
<p>These errors mean that the container is trying to start its listener, but something is already listening on the port assigned in the <strong>system.properties</strong> file.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Resolve</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Stop the container and check to make sure that nothing is running on the port that the container is configured to run on. <strong>If nothing is running</strong>, it means that the container is trying to start <strong>TWO</strong> listeners on the same port. </li>
	<li>Check <strong>system.properties</strong> in the container directory. It will have the listeners specified that the container uses on initial startup. For example:
<pre>com.soa.http.host=hostname
org.osgi.service.http.port.secure=9446
com.soa.http.bind.all.secure=true</pre>
</li>
	<li>Compare the host, port and bind settings above with the actual Policy Manager listeners defined in the Policy Manager Management Console. If the ports specified in the <strong>system.properties</strong> file are different from the ports specified in Policy Manager, the problem must exist elsewhere. If the port numbers match, then ONE of the following must occur:
<ul>
			<li><strong>com.soa.http.bind.all.secure</strong> in the system.properties file AND the <strong>Bind to All Interfaces</strong> option for the HTTPS container listener in the Policy Manager Management Console must both be set.</li>
			<li>The <strong>com.soa.http.host</strong> value in the <strong>system.properties</strong> file and the <strong>hostname</strong> in the Policy Manager Management Console must match.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason is that when Policy Manager starts its listener, it tries to determine whether one already exists on the same port and host. If it finds one already running, it uses that port. If the host names are different, or if they are not running on all interfaces, Policy Manager might not be able to find the listener already running, and might therefore try to start a new one on the same port.</p></li>
</ol>
