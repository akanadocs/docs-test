<h2 id="prereqs">Step 1: Installation Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Installation of one of the supported platform versions. </li>
	<li>A Policy Manager container must be defined using the <strong>Configure Container Instance Wizard</strong>.</li>
	<li>If you are using MySQL 5.6 <!--or higher -->with Policy Manager 8.0 and/or Policy Manager 8.0 and Community Manager 8.0 a series of MySQL property settings must be configured. See <a href="../platform_install/install_mysql_dbsettings.htm">MySQL Database Property Settings</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="install_pmservices">Step 2: Install Policy Manager Services Feature </h2>
<ol>
	<li>Launch the <strong>Akana Administration Console</strong> (http://&lt;hostname:&lt;port&gt;/admin/).</li>
	<li>On the <strong>Installed Features</strong> screen, select <strong>Feature</strong> from the <strong>Filter</strong> menu. </li>
	<li>Select the <strong>Policy Manager Services</strong> feature and click <strong>Install Feature</strong>.</li>
	<li>After the installation is complete, click <strong>Configure </strong>and continue to Step 3. </li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="config_keys">Step 3: Configure PKI Keys</h2>
<ol>
	<li>The <strong>Manage PKI Keys Wizard</strong> wizard allows you to configure the private key and certificate for the container when communicating with a governance console.</li>
	<li>Select a &quot;Key Management Option&quot; and click <strong>Next</strong> to continue. For this walkthrough we will use the default key option <strong>Generate PKI Keys &amp; X.509 Certificate</strong>. </li>
	<li>Refer to <a href="../key_management/key_management.htm">Managing Keys and Certificates</a> for more information about each option and configuration instructions.</li>
	<li>After completing the key management task, click <strong>Next</strong> to continue.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="config_db">Step 4: Configure Database Options</h2>
<ol>
	<li>The <strong>Configure Database Options Wizard</strong> &gt; <strong>Select Database Option</strong> screen provides options for selecting the database to be used with the current container configuration.
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you're using Oracle 18c or later, it's important that you create the database first, and then, in the <strong>Configure Database Options</strong> wizard, choose the <strong>Use Existing Database</strong> option (see <a href="../../sp/platform_install/installing_akana_api_platform_v2019.htm#database_creation_oracle_18c">Database creation, Oracle 18c or later</a>).</p>
	</li>
	<li>Refer to <a href="config_actions.htm#aac_ca_adddatabase">Configure Database Options / Add Database</a> for more information about available options, properties for your specific database type, and configuration instructions. </li>
	<li><strong>For MSSQL users.</strong> Complete the following steps after you configure MSSQL and receive the summary screen confirmation. </li>
	<li>You must set the quartz trigger property to <strong>True</strong>. This is a required to prevent database dead-locks. </li>
	<li>Select the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab and the <strong>com.soa.scheduler.quartz</strong> Configuration Category. Change the <strong>org.quartz.jobStore.acquireTriggersWithinLock</strong> property to <strong>B</strong>. Resume the Policy Manager configuration after completing this task.</li>
</ol>


<h3>For MSSQL Users</h3>
<p>Complete the following steps after you configure MSSQL and receive the summary screen confirmation. You must set the quartz trigger property to <strong>True</strong>. This is a required to prevent database dead-locks.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab and the <strong>com.soa.scheduler.quartz</strong> Configuration Category. Change the <strong>org.quartz.jobStore.acquireTriggersWithinLock</strong> property to <strong>True</strong> and <strong>Apply Changes</strong>. Resume the Policy Manager configuration after completing this task.</li>
</ol>
<h3>For MySQL 5.6 and Users (Policy Manager 8.0 and Community Manager 8.0 only)</h3>
<p>If you are using MySQL 5.6 <!--or higher -->with Policy Manager 8.0 and/or Policy Manager 8.0 and Community Manager 8.0 a series of MySQL property settings must be configured. See <a href="../platform_install/install_mysql_dbsettings.htm">MySQL Database Property Settings</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="provision">Step 5: Perform Provisioning</h2>
<p>Provisioning initializes resources associated with the current feature set being installed. For example, if you install both the Policy Manager Services and Policy Manager Console features and enable provisioning, the system will add system services, default policies, default workflows, a default container to the Policy Manager Management Console, and will create a Policy Manager Admin User account. In this scenario, if you did not enable provisioning, you would not be able to log into the Policy Manager Management Console unless another Policy Manager container was provisioned.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This feature is introduced in Policy Manager 8.0. If you are using an earlier Policy Manager version, skip this step.</p>
<p>There may be scenarios where provisioning is not required. For example, if the current deployment is using a read-only database you could disable provisioning.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select the &ldquo;Perform Provisioning&rdquo; checkbox to enable provisioning. Uncheck it to skip provisioning for the current feature set. After making your selection click &ldquo;Finish.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a one time configuration task performed in the Administration Console, and does not appear in the Configure &gt; Configuration Categories section after you have completed the feature configuration.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="config_cred">Step 6: Configure Policy Manager Administrator Credentials </h2>
<p>The <strong>Policy Manager Administrator Credentials</strong> screen is used to create an &quot;Administrator&quot; user account definition for logging into the <strong>Policy Manager Management Console</strong>. The user account definition is composed of a &quot;Username&quot; and &quot;Password.&quot; After restarting the <strong>Akana Administration Console</strong>, you can log into the <strong>Policy Manager Management Console</strong> using the administrator credentials. The User Account definition can be updated via the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a one time configuration task performed in the Administration Console, and does not appear in the Configure &gt; Configuration Categories section after you have completed the feature configuration.</p>
<ol>
	<li>In the &quot;Credentials&quot; section, enter &quot;Username,&quot; &quot;New Password,&quot; and &quot;Confirm New Password&quot; for the Policy Manager &quot;Administrator&quot; user account. After completing your entries, click <strong>Finish</strong>. The system restart message displays. Click <strong>OK</strong> to restart the system, click <strong>Cancel</strong> to restart the system later.</li>
	<li>When the &quot;Complete Configuration&quot; screen displays, continue to the next step.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="config_complete">Step 7: Complete Configuration</h2>
<ol>
	<li>The <strong>Complete Configuration</strong> task performs configuration operations associated with one or more &quot;Feature&quot; installations. Operations typically include starting components, setting property values, and initializing credentials.</li>
	<li>The system restart was initiated when <strong>Finish</strong> was clicked on the <strong>Credentials Summary</strong> screen. After the system restarts and initializes the installed features for use, click <strong>Close</strong> to log out of the <strong>Akana Administration Console</strong>. </li>
	<li>To exit the wizard and perform a system restart at a later time, click <strong>Close</strong>. Configuration changes are saved and the <strong>Complete Configuration</strong> task is available via the &quot;Installed Features&quot; tab in the &quot;Pending Installation Tasks&quot; section.</li>
