<h2 id="f_2020.1.0">Key Features</h2>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The key features here are specific to 2020.1.0 and are not available in earlier 2019.1.x update releases. For features and enhancements also available in 2020.1.0 but delivered in previous update releases, refer to individual versions of the Release Notes.</p>
<h5>API Charts enhancements</h5>
<h6>Operational metrics improvements </h6>
<p>The information reported and displayed in API transaction logs now includes several new metrics to provide additional information about the timing of exchange processing in the API Gateway. This allows for the measurement of timings such as TTFB (Time to First Byte), I/O times, and API Gateway processing times. These new metrics are used to provide enhanced feedback in the Portal user interface for API analytics. See<a href="http://docs.akana.com/docs-test/cm/learnmore/apiadmin_monitoring.htm#api_logs_ttfb"> Viewing the time to first byte (TTFB) metric</a> on the Akana docs site.</p>
<h6>Monthly reports</h6>
<p>The developer portal now includes a monthly report that provides a visual summary of metric information across all businesses for the tenant. Data can be broken out by day if needed, and includes platform API usage, customer API usage, and totals for resources such as apps and APIs. See<a href="http://docs.akana.com/docs-test/cm/learnmore/bus_admin_org_root_monthly_report.htm"> Monthly Report</a> for detail.</p>
<h6>My Dashboard</h6>
<p>The developer portal now includes a new dashboard that the API Admin can use to monitor up to 10 top APIs. Users can adjust the visual display as needed, including adjusting duration and interval for the chart and removing one or more APIs from the display. The My Dashboard feature includes charts for Throughput, Request Size, and Response Time. See<a href="http://docs.akana.com/docs-test/cm/learnmore/apiadmin_mydashboard.htm"> Monitoring Top APIs with the My Dashboard Feature</a> on the Akana docs site.</p>
<h5>API documentation enhancements</h5>
<p>Multiple improvements have been made to the generated Swagger 2.0 API documentation  for improved usability, including converting the description from a column to a row, adding color for easy identification of the sample JSON, and improving readability by moving the operation summary and providing better spacing.</p>

<h5>Internationalization of error messages and UI copy </h5>
<p>The platformâ€™s support of dynamic deployment of error messages and UI copy, introduced in 2019.1.12, has been enhanced to require specifying the resource bundle base name in the Java properties file. Generated documentation now includes a summary of resource bundles for UI copy and error messages. Specifying the resource bundle base name helps identify the resources in use, which helps reduce the likelihood of collisions and speeds up lookups. See<a href="http://docs.akana.com/docs-test/ag/custom_development/error_message_internationalization.htm"> Internationalizing Error Messages and UI Copy</a> on the Akana docs site.</p>
<h5>MySQL 8.0 support </h5>
<p>Support has been added for MySQL 8.0. </p>
<p>Note that MySQL 8.0.x uses GROUPS as a reserved word, so the platform's table name GROUPS has been changed to CM_GROUPS.</p>
<h5>Enhancements to deployment automation</h5>
<p>This release includes numerous enhancements to the recipes that automate deployment. See<a href="#ATMO-33898"> Deployment Automation Improvements</a> for details.</p>
