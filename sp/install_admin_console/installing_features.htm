<h2><a href="../admin_console/using_network_director_feature.htm">Network Director</a></h2>
<p>This feature enables a Container to host Virtual Services. The Virtual Services are defined in the Policy Manager Management Console. When the Network Director feature is enabled, the Container's metadata is updated to reflect this support. The metadata must be updated in the Policy Manager Management Console so that it is aware that Virtual Services can be hosted on the Container. The feature also enables support for default Bindings and Policies. The default Bindings are SOAP and HTTP (REST and POX). The default Policies are WS-Addressing, WS-Auditing, WS-Security, HTTP Security, Authentication, and Authorization.</p>
