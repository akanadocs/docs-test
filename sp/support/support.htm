<h2 id="s01_02_03">Support Tickets: Customer Responsibilities</h2>
<p>When logging a support ticket, please bear in mind these additional points and customer responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Please make sure that the issue is related to the Akana product. In some cases, issues are caused by other factors such as network, firewall, or security certificates.</li>
	<li>In case of a Production Critical issue, you can contact Akana Technical Support immediately and one of our knowledgeable support staff will help you troubleshoot your problem and collect information for further diagnosis. If you are reporting the issue by email, specify in the subject line that it is Production Critical. A production critical issue is defined as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>Actual or potential complete failure of traffic on a critical route due to failure of a system or network element.</li>
			<li>Complete or partial loss of visibility/control of network elements.</li>
			<li>Loss or impairment of control/monitoring equipment.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Document the scenario/steps to reproduce the issue. If it's not possible to reproduce the issue, explain what was happening at the time you experienced the issue and what then occurred.</li>
	<li>Provide the appropriate log files from all Akana containers that are involved in the request flow.</li>
	<li>Collect any other information that you think will be useful for Akana engineers to understand and troubleshoot the issue.</li>
	<li>Report the issue to Akana Technical Support using one of the options listed earlier in this section.</li>
</ul>
