<h4 id="upgrade_micro">Overview</h4>
<p>If you're updating from a major or micro version to a later micro update&#8212;for example, version 8.4.1 to 8.4.22&#8212;it's important to follow through the entire upgrade procedure. Even though it's a micro-release, it's important that you don't miss any steps. Be sure to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Check for version-specific steps: see <a href="#upgrade_version_specific_steps">Checking for version-specific steps</a>.</li>
	<li>Review common errors and make sure you don't skip those steps: see <a href="#upgrade_common_errors">Common upgrade errors</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="upgrade_version_specific_steps">Checking for version-specific steps</h4>
<p>In some cases, upgrading to a specific micro-version might require an additional step that isn't part of the core upgrade process, such as a specific configuration task.</p>
<p>In defining the upgrade process you're going to follow, check for information in these two places:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>The main upgrade instructions for the main version you're upgrading to</strong>:
		<ul>
			<li>Version 8.4: <a href="upgrading_akana_api_platform_82_84.htm">Upgrading Akana API Platform from Version 8.2 to Version 8.4x</a></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li><strong>Release notes for the micro version you're upgrading to</strong>: Check for any additional upgrade steps that might be covered in the release notes for the specific micro version. Release notes are available with the product ZIP files on the Rogue Wave Support Center (<a href="https://library.roguewave.com" target="_blank">https://library.roguewave.com</a>).</li>
	<li><a href="#version_specific_steps_84">Summary of version-specific steps for version 8.4x</a> below.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="upgrade_common_errors">Common upgrade errors</h4>
<p>Here are some reminders for specific tasks that are part of the standard upgrade process but are sometimes forgotten, either in a major or minor upgrade, causing problems with the installation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Forgetting to delete the configuration cache file. See <a href="upgrading_akana_api_platform_82_84.htm#s02_05">Step 2-5: Clear Configurator cache (if needed)</a>.</li>
	<li>Setting up the <strong>update.properties</strong> file correctly for the version, if you're using Silent Upgrade mode. See <a href="upgrading_akana_api_platform_82_84.htm#s02_06_02">Upgrade container to Akana API Platform 8.4 (silent upgrade)</a> (this is part of Step 2-6).</li>
	<li><strong>Clear browser cache before launching the upgraded Akana Administration Console</strong>. If you don't clear the browser cache and refresh, you won't see the user interface changes included in the update (if any). See <a href="upgrading_akana_api_platform_82_84.htm#s02_10">Step 2-10: Clear browser cache</a>.</li>
	<li>After upgrade, if you're upgrading existing containers, turn scheduled jobs back on. Part of the upgrade process is turning off the scheduled jobs; but it's important to turn them back on afterwards (<strong>simple.scheduler.enabled</strong> and <strong>org.quartz.scheduler.enable</strong> properties both set to <strong>true</strong>). This step must be run on one container that's connected to the database. Refer to the following steps in the upgrade documentation:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="upgrading_akana_api_platform_82_84.htm#s02_01">Step 2-1: Turn off scheduled jobs</a></li>
			<li><a href="upgrading_akana_api_platform_82_84.htm#s02_17">Step 2-17: Turn scheduled jobs back on</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="version_specific_steps_84">Summary of version-specific steps for version 8.4.x</h4>
<p>Version 8.4 includes the following version-specific steps shown below. If you're upgrading from a version before to a version after any of the below items, be sure to include that step in your upgrade process.</p>
<table class="doctable">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>This version...</th>
			<th>Included the following specific upgrade step...</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>8.4.6</td>
			<td><p>Version 8.4.6 includes an optional JRE update required for the platform's support of a specific HSM device.</p>
				<p>The version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that the  platform  uses was upgraded to version 1.8.0_144. This was needed for the   platform&rsquo;s support of the Thales HSM NCipher security provider.<br />
				  If you're not using an HSM, upgrading is not necessary. However, because the JRE  is bundled with the Akana Platform installation, if you want the JRE  upgrade you'll need to get the full ZIP file that includes it.  Follow the basic instructions for downloading and installing  files from the Akana Support Site (see <a href="http://docs.akana.com/sp/upgrade/upgrading_akana_api_platform_82_84.htm#01_03">http://docs.akana.com/sp/upgrade/upgrading_akana_api_platform_82_84.htm#01_03</a>),  but:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>For the Akana Platform on Linux, get this file: <strong>akana-platform-linux-jre-8.4.6.zip</strong></li>
					<li>For the Akana Platform on Windows, get this  file: <strong>akana-platform-win-jre-8.4.6.zip</strong></li>
		</ul></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>8.4.9</td>
			<td><p>Two additional steps:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Run the <strong>Manage Schemas</strong> upgrade task, which is included in the automated upgrade process.</li>
					<li>After the upgrade process is complete, run the <strong>Provisioning</strong> upgrade task (<strong>Admin Console</strong> &gt; <strong>Configuration</strong> &gt; <strong>Configuration Actions</strong> &gt; <strong>Provisioning</strong>).</li>
				</ul>
