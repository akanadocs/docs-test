<h2 id="top">Use Case: Upgrading with Zero Downtime</h2>
<p>This use case outlines a scenario for achieving a zero-downtime upgrade in an implementation of the Akana API Platform spanning multiple data centers.</p>
<p>This example includes two data centers, but the approach would work in exactly the same way for any number of data centers. The upgrade is from version 8.2 to 8.4.</p>
<p>Note that in this example, the term <strong>zero-downtime</strong> is used to mean that the API Gateway has zero downtime. It's possible that during the upgrade process either Policy Manager or Community Manager, or both, might experience some downtime. This might be necessary if the upgrade includes database schema changes.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This use case provides an approach for manual upgrade across multiple data centers. However, the best, and recommended, approach for upgrade in a production environment is via automation, which is available as a service from the Akana Professional Services department. For details about automation options, contact your Akana representative.</p>

<a name="zerodowntime_01"></a><h3>Multiple data center scenario</h3>
<p>This approach upgrades data centers one by one. While one data center is being upgraded, the remaining data centers (one or more) service all traffic.</p>
<p>Key points relating to this use case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Only Policy Manager and Community Manager have direct access to the MongoDB database. This assumes that the Network Director is pushing all its writes to MongoDB via the Policy Manager server.</li>
  <li>To maintain zero downtime, all containers must have access to the <strong>Master Policy Manager</strong>. During the upgrade process, the container that is designated as the <strong>Master Policy Manager</strong> changes between data centers. The Master Policy Manager is defined as the Policy Manager container, or set of Policy Manager containers, that are configured against the writable database.</li>
</ul>


<a name="zerodowntime_01_00"></a><h4>Initial (Pre-Upgrade) State</h4>
<p>The diagram below shows the environment before upgrade. Active-Active MongoDB infrastructure has been implemented.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<a name="zerodowntime_01_01"></a><h4>Step 1: Upgrade Data Center B</h4>
<p>In this step, we first move all traffic to data center A, so that traffic is uninterrupted while data center B is being upgraded. We then perform the upgrade.</p>
<h5>High-level summary of steps</h5>
<p>For this scenario, you'll need to complete these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Change the databases: define the writable database and change the direction of the replication.
    <p>We flip the databases and make data center B the writable database, and change the direction of the replication. This allows you to move the <strong>Master</strong> data center back and forth. If you prefer a different sequence, you can start with upgrading data center A, and its database will always stay active.</p></li>
  <li>Update the scheduled jobs.
  <p>Changing the <strong>Master</strong>/writable data center also requires an update to the scheduled jobs. When building the new <strong>Master</strong> Policy Manager, the scheduled jobs must be running from this container. To do this, set the property <strong>org.quartz.scheduler.enabled</strong> to <strong>true</strong>. For all other containers that have scheduled jobs installed, set the property to <strong>false</strong>. For instructions, see <a href="upgrading_akana_api_platform_82_84.htm#02_01">Step 2-1: Turn off scheduled jobs</a>. Remember to restore the setting afterwards.</p></li>
  <li>Upgrade the data center B environment.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Upgrading the data center B environment</h5>
<p>The order of execution for upgrading data center B is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Upgrade a Policy Manager container first. As part of the upgrade process for this Policy Manager container, the database is upgraded with any required schema changes.</li>
  <li>After upgrade of the initial Policy Manager container is complete, upgrade all other containers. Order doesn't matter; you could even upgrade additional containers concurrently.</li>
</ol>
<p>The diagram below shows the upgrade from 8.2 to 8.4 being done for data center B. Traffic is processed via data center A.</p>
<p><img src="images_zero/uc_01_02.jpg" alt="Upgrading with zero downtime: upgrading data center B" /></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="zerodowntime_01_02"></a><a name="zerodowntime_01_00"></a><h4>Step 2: Test</h4>
<p>Once you've upgraded a data center, you can test by conducting percentage testing of the environment. This allows you to upgrade one side of the model, and then bring the upgraded data center back into receiving traffic. You can configure the router to direct only a certain amount of traffic to the upgraded side.</p>
<p>The illustration below shows a 60/40 mix. This means that 60% of the traffic continues to go down the 8.2 branch, and  40% is going to the upgraded data center. This allows you to validate that changes in the upgrade are not causing any issues.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the upgrade being done for data center B. Traffic is processed via data center A.</p>
<p><img src="images_zero/uc_01_03.jpg" alt="Upgrading with zero downtime: percentage test" /></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="zerodowntime_01_03"></a><h4>Step 3: Upgrade Data Center A</h4>
<p>Once you're sure everything is working perfectly with data center B, it's time to upgrade data center A.</p>
<p>To do this, first direct all traffic from the global router to data center B. The <strong>Master</strong> Policy Manager is now the Policy Manager, or bank of Policy Managers, that are running in data center B.</p>
<p><span class="apidoc_red">The automation container properties file</span> adds the property <strong>pm.master.address</strong>, which points to the <strong>Master</strong> Policy Manager address. Typically, this would be a load balancer sitting in front of those Policy Managers. This does require a firewall between the data centers for this communication. {<span class="apidoc_red">what do we need to say about putting together the properties file? Is a link to <a href="../admin_console/using_network_director_feature.htm#container_silent">Step 2b: Configure Container (Silent Option)</a> OK? Or, if they won't use a properties file, what instruction is needed here?</span>}</p>
<p>Now, run through the upgrade process for data center A. In this example, we are upgrading from 8.2 to 8.4. During any steps that require database writes, the scripts reach out to the configured <strong>Master</strong> database. {<span class="apidoc_red">how do they do this manually?</span>}</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the upgrade being done for data center A. Traffic is processed via data center B.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<a name="zerodowntime_01_04"></a><h4>Final state after upgrade</h4>
<p>The final state would be back to both data centers upgraded, active, and accepting traffic, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="images_zero/uc_01_05.jpg" alt="Upgrading with zero downtime: final state after upgrade" /></p>

<p>Now, when it's time to do the next upgrade setup, follow the same steps, but change the sequence of the data centers. In the diagram above, notice that the writable database goes back to data center A. Also, remember that the <strong>Master</strong> Policy Manager always follows the writable database.</p>

<p><img src="images_zero/uc_01_06.jpg" alt="Upgrading with zero downtime: single data center model" /></p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<a name="zerodowntime_02"></a><h3>Single data center scenario</h3>
<p>Even if you only have a single data center, you can still achieve a zero-downtime deployment. The approach is very similar to the approach for multiple data centers; the only difference is that rather than a single data center remaining active, one side of the node remains active.</p>
<p>The database is never moved; you will always have a single database instance that is always the active database.</p>
<p>You don't have to worry about using a <strong>Master</strong> Policy Manager instance, since there will never be a read-only database in the model.</p>
<p>The connections that are important in this model are the links into the Policy Manager cluster first. The steps are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, remove 1 and direct all traffic to a single Policy Manager.</li>
  <li>Upgrade the Policy Manager that is out of the cluster.</li>
  <li>Once you've upgraded that Policy Manager, add it back into the cluster.</li>
  <li>Now upgrade the other node.</li>
  <li>Follow the same steps for upgrading the Network Director, one at a time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this is only viable for data centers that have multiple nodes deployed; at minimum, the gateways must have multiple nodes. Zero-downtime upgrades can still be achieved with single Policy Manager node clusters.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows zero-downtime upgrade for a single data center.</p>
