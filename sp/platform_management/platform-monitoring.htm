<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This document describes ways to monitor the platform - specifically log analysis and database monitoring. It is currently a work in progress.</p>



<h2 id="operational_gen">General Operational Monitoring</h2>
<p>There are several key operational metrics to monitor on all servers:</p>
<ul>
	<li>CPU utilization</li>
	<li>Disk utilization</li>
	<li>Zombie processes</li>
	<li>Total processes</li>
	<li>Available swap space</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools like Nagios provide guidelines on configuring monitoring for the operating system and we recommend that you consult their documentation in detail. As an example, we commonly leverage the following Nagios checks for our own systems:</p>
<pre>command[check_load]=/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_load -w 15,10,5 -c 30,25,20
command[check_disk]=/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_disk -w 20% -c 10% -e
command[check_zombie_procs]=/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_procs -w 5 -c 10 -s Z
command[check_total_procs]=/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_procs -w 150 -c 200
command[check_swap]=/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_swap -w 20 -c 10</pre>



<h2 id="db_mon">Database Monitoring</h2>
<p>There are several key operational / application metrics and conditions to monitor for on the platform database server. The example script below demonstrates how the most common monitors can be aggregated together and applied to a MySQL database server. Each one will be explained in more detail in the next section:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash

NL=$'\n'
ERROR_MSG=""
BLK=""
DB_STAT='cat /var/tmp/db_stat'
DB_USER=""
DB_PASS=""
DB_NAME=""

sqlcmd="mysql -u $DB_USER -p${DB_PASS} -D $db -BNe"
query="select count(*) from MSG_QUEUE"
result='$sqlcmd "$query"'
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
[ "$result" -a $result -gt 10 ] &amp;&amp; ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"MSG_QUEUE is more than 10 in $db database: ${result}${NL}"

query="select max(DELIVERYATTEMPTS) from MSG_QUEUE"
result='$sqlcmd "$query"'
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
if [ "$result" != "NULL" ];then
   [ $result -gt 10 ] &amp;&amp; ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"There are more than 10 retries in $db database DELIVERYATTEMPTS: ${result}${NL}"
fi

query="select count(*) from INDEX_QUEUE"
result='$sqlcmd "$query"'
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
[ $result -gt 20 ] &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;
query="select * from SOA_QRTZ_TRIGGERS where TRIGGER_STATE = 'BLOCKED' and TRIGGER_NAME not in (select TRIGGER_NAME from SOA_QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS)"
result='$sqlcmd "$query"'
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
[ ! -z "$result" -a "$result" != "NULL" ] &amp;&amp; { ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"There are blocked jobs in $db database:${NL}${result}${NL}"; BLK="1"; }

query="select * from SOA_QRTZ_TRIGGERS where TRIGGER_STATE = 'ACQUIRED' and TRIGGER_NAME not in (select TRIGGER_NAME from SOA_QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS)"
result='$sqlcmd "$query"'
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
[ ! -z "$result" -a "$result" != "NULL" ] &amp;&amp; ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"There are acquired jobs in $db database:${NL}${result}${NL}";

query="select TRIGGER_NAME, STATE, INSTANCE_NAME, FROM_UNIXTIME(FIRED_TIME/1000), \"GMT\" from SOA_QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS where FIRED_TIME/1000 &lt;= UNIX_TIMESTAMP(TIMESTAMPADD(MINUTE, -10, now()))"
result='$sqlcmd "$query"'
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
[ ! -z "$result" -a "$result" != "NULL" ] &amp;&amp; ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"Below jobs are running for longer than 10 minutes in $db database:${NL}TRIGGER_NAME\tSTATE\tINSTANCE_NAME\tFIRED_TIME\tGMT${NL}${result}${NL}"

query="select EVENTID, EVENTTYPE, SOURCEFEDMEMBERID, TARGETFEDMEMBERID, CREATEDDTS, LASTPOSTEDDTS, STATUS, NUMTRIES, EVENTCTXDATAID from EVENT_QUEUE
where (STATUS='event.status.pending' and NUMTRIES > 3) or (STATUS='event.status.suspended')";
result='$sqlcmd "$query"'
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
if [ ! -z "$result" -a "$result" != "NULL" ];then
   ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"Potential federation issues. Event pending after too many tries:{NL}${result}${NL}"
fi

sqlcmd="mysql -u $DB_USER -p${DB_PASS} -D mysql -BNe"
query="SHOW PROCESSLIST"
result='$sqlcmd "$query" | grep $DB_NAME | wc -l'
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
[ $result -ge 180 ] &amp;&amp; ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"Master database has $result sockets exhausted out of 180"

if [ -n "$ERROR_MSG" ]; then
  [ -n "$BLK" ] &amp;&amp; DB_STAT='expr $DB_STAT + 1' || DB_STAT=1;
  echo "$DB_STAT" > /var/tmp/db_stat;
  echo -e "$ERROR_MSG";
elif [ $DB_STAT -ge 1 ]; then
  echo "0" > /var/tmp/db_stat;
  echo "Database monitor is OK";
fi</pre>
<p>This script can be put in a cron job, set to run every five minutes as follows:</p>
<pre>MAILTO=prod_critical@yourcompany.com
*/5 * * * * /xxx/bin/db_monitor.sh</pre>
<p>The next sections will explain each of the metrics or conditions that are determined in the above script.</p>


<h3 id="db_msg_queue">Message queue</h3>
<p><strong>Scope</strong>: Community Manager</p>
<p>If email cannot be sent for some reason, the MSG_QUEUE table will fill up. This script will send an alert if the table contains more than 10 entries:</p>
<pre>sqlcmd="mysql -u $DB_USER -p${DB_PASS} -D $db -BNe"
query="select count(*) from MSG_QUEUE"
result=`$sqlcmd "$query"`
[ $? -ne 0 ] && { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
[ "$result" -a $result -gt 10 ] && ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"MSG_QUEUE is more than 10 in $db database: ${result}${NL}"</pre>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Inspect the container logs to see why emails are failing</p>
<p>If an email continually fails delivery for some reason, this can be detected by inspecting the DELIVERYATTEMPTS field in the MSG_QUEUE table. This script will send an alert if more than 10 delivery attempts have been made:</p>
<pre>query="select max(DELIVERYATTEMPTS) from MSG_QUEUE"
result=`$sqlcmd "$query"`
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
if [ "$result" != "NULL" ];then
   [ $result -gt 10 ] &amp;&amp; ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"There are more than 10 retries in $db database DELIVERYATTEMPTS: ${result}${NL}"
fi</pre>


<h3 id="db_idx_queue">Index queue</h3>
<p><strong>Scope</strong>: Community Manager</p>
<p>If the indexing of the Community Manager site fails for some reason, the INDEX_QUEUE table will fill up. This script will send an alert if the table contains more than 20 entries:</p>
<pre>sqlcmd="mysql -u $DB_USER -p${DB_PASS} -D $db -BNe"
query="select count(*) from INDEX_QUEUE"
result=`$sqlcmd "$query"`
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
[ $result -gt 20 ] &amp;&amp; ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"INDEX_QUEUE is more than 20 in $db database: ${result}${NL}${NL}"</pre>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: First check to see if the indexing job is stuck (next section). If not, inspect the logs to see if there is an error processing the object on the queue. Occasionally an error is caused when updating an index related to a deleted object. The only option is to delete the offending row from the table and send the logs to support@akana.com.</p>


<h3 id="db_scheduler">Scheduler</h3>
<p><strong>Scope</strong>: Community Manager and Policy Manager</p>
<p>Occasionally the scheduled jobs can get stuck in a state where they are blocked or thought to be running, but are not. These scripts will send an alert if these occur:</p>
<pre> sqlcmd="mysql -u $DB_USER -p${DB_PASS} -D $db -BNe"
query="select * from SOA_QRTZ_TRIGGERS where TRIGGER_STATE = 'BLOCKED' and TRIGGER_NAME not in (select TRIGGER_NAME from SOA_QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS)"
result=`$sqlcmd "$query"`
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
[ ! -z "$result" -a "$result" != "NULL" ] &amp;&amp; { ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"There are blocked jobs in $db database:${NL}${result}${NL}"; BLK="1"; }

query="select * from SOA_QRTZ_TRIGGERS where TRIGGER_STATE = 'ACQUIRED' and TRIGGER_NAME not in (select TRIGGER_NAME from SOA_QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS)"
result=`$sqlcmd "$query"`
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
[ ! -z "$result" -a "$result" != "NULL" ] &amp;&amp; ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"There are acquired jobs in $db database:${NL}${result}${NL}";</pre>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Reset the relevant TRIGGER_STATE to 'WAITING' in the SOA_QRTZ_TRIGGERS table</p>
<p>It is often useful to know if a particular scheduled job has been executing for too long - this is often a sign of database contention or poor database maintenance. This script will send an alert if any scheduled job takes longer than 10 minutes:</p>
<pre>query="select TRIGGER_NAME, STATE, INSTANCE_NAME, FROM_UNIXTIME(FIRED_TIME/1000), \"GMT\" from SOA_QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS where FIRED_TIME/1000 &lt;= UNIX_TIMESTAMP(TIMESTAMPADD(MINUTE, -10, now()))"
result=`$sqlcmd "$query"`
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
[ ! -z "$result" -a "$result" != "NULL" ] &amp;&amp; ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"Below jobs are running for longer than 10 minutes in $db database:${NL}TRIGGER_NAME\tSTATE\tINSTANCE_NAME\tFIRED_TIME\tGMT${NL}${result}${NL}"</pre>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Inspect the thread dump to see if the Quartz job is running. If it is not, delete the row from the SOA_QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS table and reset the relevant TRIGGER_STATE to 'WAITING' in the SOA_QRTZ_TRIGGERS table.</p>


<h3 id="db_fed">Federation Synchronization</h3>
<p><strong>Scope</strong>: Community Manager</p>
<p>If you have implemented a federation between Community Manager tenants, the synchronization of events between the members of the federation can fail and the EVENT_QUEUE table will start filling up. This query examines this table for federation events in a bad state:</p>
<pre>query="select EVENTID, EVENTTYPE, SOURCEFEDMEMBERID, TARGETFEDMEMBERID, CREATEDDTS, LASTPOSTEDDTS, STATUS, NUMTRIES, EVENTCTXDATAID from EVENT_QUEUE
where (STATUS='event.status.pending' and NUMTRIES > 3) or (STATUS='event.status.suspended')";
result=`$sqlcmd "$query"`
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
if [ ! -z "$result" -a "$result" != "NULL" ];then
   ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"Potential federation issues. Event pending after too many tries:{NL}${result}${NL}"
fi</pre>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Contact Akana support at support@akana.com.</p>


<h3 id="db_connection_pool">Connection pool</h3>
<p><strong>Scope</strong>: All products</p>
<p>It is important to monitoring the number of database connections the platform is consuming and warn when then number climbs above a threshold of 80%. The following script snippet illustrates how this can be done:</p>
<pre>sqlcmd="mysql -u $DB_USER -p${DB_PASS} -D mysql -BNe"
query="SHOW PROCESSLIST"
result=`$sqlcmd "$query" | grep $DB_NAME | wc -l`
[ $? -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; { echo "Cannot connect to database"; exit 1; }
[ $result -ge 180 ] &amp;&amp; ERROR_MSG=${ERROR_MSG}"Master database has $result sockets exhausted out of 180"</pre>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: The number of connections that the database is willing to accept must be greater than all the connection pools of all the containers connecting to the database. For MySQL, add/edit the following line under [mysqld] in my.cnf:</p>
<pre>max_connections=500</pre>



<h2 id="log_mon">Log Monitoring</h2>
<p>There are several key phrases to search for within the platform logs. The following example script demonstrates how Nagios can be configured with a set of critical errors that can occur in the log:</p>
<pre>@searches = ({
  logfile => '/root/sm70/instances/@HNAME@/log/@HNAME@.log',
  rotation => 'loglog0log1',
  criticalpatterns => ['OutOfMemoryError',
        'Cannot get a connection, pool exhausted',
        'Error in creating Prepared statement for the query',
        'org.apache.lucene.store.jdbc.JdbcStoreException',
        'Timeout waiting for idle object',
        'GC overhead limit exceeded',
        'Wsdl does not conform to wsdl schema',
        'Error encountered in WS-Security engine',
        'com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException',
        'Data truncation',
		 'ERROR [DBStatementAndResultSetTracker] PreparedStatementTracker' ]
});</pre>
<p>This table explains what each of these log phrases mean:</p>
<table class="doctable">
<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Phrase/Pattern</th>
		<th>Description</th>
