<h2 id="ev_ts_01">Data not showing up as expected: data type mismatch</h2>
<p>Data can come in to Envision via the Gateway, or a third-party application can add data to Envision using a custom connector.</p>
<p>When Envision rolls up data, from either of these sources, it validates that the data is of the data type specified in the dataset definition; for example, text, numeric, or ZIP code. Data that is not the correct data type is ignored. As a result, if there is a mismatch between the dataset definition and the data coming in, the data representation will not be correct.</p>
<p>If you are not seeing your data, check the data types defined for your dataset dimensions, and make sure that the input data conforms.</p>
