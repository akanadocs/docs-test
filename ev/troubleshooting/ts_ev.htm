<h2 id="ev_ts_01">Data not showing up as expected: data type mismatch</h2>
<p>Data can come in to Envision via the Gateway, or a third-party application can add data to Envision using a custom connector.</p>
<p>When Envision rolls up data, from either of these sources, it validates that the data is of the data type specified in the dataset definition; for example, text, numeric, or ZIP code. Data that is not the correct data type is ignored. As a result, if there is a mismatch between the dataset definition and the data coming in, the data representation will not be correct.</p>
<p>If you are not seeing your data, check the data types defined for your dataset dimensions, and make sure that the input data conforms.</p>

<h2 id="ev_ts_02">Data not showing up as expected: remote writer not enabled</h2>
<p>As part of configuring Envision, you might need to enable remote writing on the Gateway manually, as covered in the Policy Manager / Envision Integrated Installation document: <a href="../envision_install/installing_pm_env_integration.htm#s05_modify_usage_writer_properties">Step 5: Modify Usage Writer Properties</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not seeing the expected data in Envision, go to the Akana Administration Console for the Policy Manager container, and verify that remote writing is enabled.</p>

<h2 id="ev_ts_03">Slow performance</h2>
<p>If there are performance issues, review the guidelines in these two documents to make sure your datasets are designed efficiently:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="../ev_designing/env_20201_building_chart.htm">Chart Building Guide for Envision</a>&#8212;Provides information to help you make design decisions for using Envision.</li>
	<li><a href="../ev_designing/env_20201_building_dataset.htm">Dataset Building Guide for Envision</a>&#8212;Includes guidance for balancing information detail and performance efficiency to represent the information that's important to you in a way that will be timely and resource-efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="ev_ts_04">Checking for startup errors</h2>
<p>If for any reason some of the Envision file bundles do not start up correctly, you might see one or more issues such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>No data is being collected, even after you correctly configured the remote writer setting (see <a href="#ev_ts_02">Data not showing up as expected: remote writer not enabled</a> above).</li>
	<li>You are unable to access the Envision user interface or any portion of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are problems, make sure that there are no startup errors in your Envision container, and verify that all the bundles have started. If necessary, restart the container.</p>
<p>For information about reviewing startup errors, restarting the container, and other general troubleshooting tips, refer to <a href="../../ag/troubleshooting/ts__toc.htm">Troubleshooting Content Overview</a> and linked files. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Viewing errors if bundles have not started: <a href="../../ag/troubleshooting/ts_pm_nd_01.htm#s01_05">stdout.txt File</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="ev_ts_05">Updating the list of allowed/denied characters</h2>
<h4 class="stamp">Valid in Version: 2020.2.4 and later</h4>
<p>You might find that there are issues in Envision with names or descriptions being rejected due to denied characters.</p>
<p>When Envision is installed, there is a default list of characters that are rejected in Envision when creating charts, dashboards, or database objects. This is controlled by a configuration property in the Akana Administration Console, and can be modified by the Administrator if needed, to either remove characters from the denylist or add new ones.</p>
<p>For more information, and instructions, see <a href="../envision_install/installing_envision.htm#ca_configure_ev_denylist">Configuration properties: Configuring the denylist characters</a>.</p>
