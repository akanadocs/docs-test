<h1 id="top">Changes in the Envision 2020.1.1 Release</h1>
<p>The Envision 2020.1.1 release is a major update so that Envision is compatible with the latest version of the Akana API Platform (2020.1.0).</p>
<p>For details about the key features and enhancements in this release, see <a href="https://docs.roguewave.com/en/akana/akana-release-notes" title="Link to Akana Release Notes for 2020.1.0" target="_blank">Akana Release Notes</a></span>.</p>
<p>In version 2020.1.1, the Operational Metrics Policy, with its default settings that populated the Operational Metric Dataset, is deprecated. The policy and the dataset both currently appear in the user interface, but will be removed in a later version. We recommend that you do not use this dataset and its associated policy.</p>
<p>Instead, use the Business Metrics Policy, which has much more flexibility for configuring the parameters of your dataset.</p>
<p>For guidelines and recommendations regarding how to optimize your data parameters and dataset so that you get the information you need while maintaining optimal performance, refer to these two new documents:</p>
