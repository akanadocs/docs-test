<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This plug-in provides a series of sample data sets for demo charts that can be installed to the <strong>Envision Console</strong>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>When you install a sample data set, the associated Widget and Dashboard are added to the Envision Console.</li>
	<li>These datasets provide you with a good starting point for becoming familiar with the Envision product and generating sample charts.</li>
	<li>The sample datasets can also be selected and used in the Business Metrics Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Installation of the <strong>Akana Envision</strong> feature is required to view and use the sample data sets in the <strong>Envision Console</strong> and in the <strong>Business Metrics Policy</strong>, but you can install the <strong>Sample Data Sets for Demo Charts</strong> feature and connect to the MongoDB database without pre-installing the <strong>Akana Envision</strong> feature.</p>
