<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This plug-in installs extensions that will collect metrics for the Envision product. Requires the Network Director or Policy Manager Services features.</p>
<ul>
	<li>This plug-in is required if you are using separate containers for Policy Manager and Network Director.</li>
	<li>The plug-in is installed to the Policy Manager container as part of the <strong>Envision Policy Manager Console Extension Feature</strong> and must be installed separately to the Network Director container.</li>
	<li>If you have the Network Director feature installed on the Policy Manager container, installation of this feature is <strong>not</strong> required as the plug-in is already installed as part of the <strong>Envision Policy Manager Console Extension Feature</strong>.</li>
	<li>Having the plug-in installed on both Policy Manager and Network Director containers enables the ability to extract data from various payloads using the <strong>Business Metrics Policy</strong>.</li>
</ul>
