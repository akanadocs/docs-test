<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Envision is a data visualization tool that integrates with the Policy Manager Management Console.</p>



<h2 id="ev_install_01">Envision Installation Selections</h2>
<p>Envision installation options include one feature and three plug-ins.</p>


<h3 id="ev_install_01_01">Envision Feature</h3>
<p>The Envision feature installs the standalone Analytics Manager user interface and associated services.</p>
<p>This feature must be installed into the Policy Manager container instance. Requires that the Policy Manager Console feature be installed to the Policy Manager container instance.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that MongoDB is set up and started before proceeding with this installation, so that you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect to the MongoClientURI.</li>
<li>Modify the associated policies after logging into the Policy Manager Management Console.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of installing this feature, when you click <strong>Configure</strong>, in the <strong>Configure MongoDB Database Wizard</strong>, you'll need to provide the MongoClientURI. See <a href="../../sp/admin_console/config_actions.htm#aac_ca_configure_mongodb_database">Configure MongoDB Database Wizard (Envision only)</a>.</p>


<h3 id="ev_install_02_00">Envision Plug-Ins</h3>
<p>The following plug-ins are applicable to Envision:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#ev_install_02_01">Akana Envision Metrics Collector</a></li>
	<li><a href="#ev_install_02_02">Akana Envision Policy Manager Console Extensions</a></li>
	<li><a href="#ev_install_02_03">Akana Envision Service Extensions</a></li>
	<li><a href="#ev_install_02_04">Akana Policy Manager Security Provider for Envision</a></li>
	<li><a href="#ev_install_02_05">Akana Sample Datasets for Demo Charts</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ev_install_02_01">Akana Envision Metrics Collector</h4>
<p>The Akana Envision Metrics Collector plug-in is technically an optional plug-in, but is needed in order to retrieve the metrics data from the API Gateway and channel it to Envision. Without this plug-in you could pull data from another source, but not from the API Gateway (Network Director).</p>
<p>Installs extensions that will capture metrics from Network Director for use by Envision.</p>
<p>This plugin is installed on a container with the Network Director feature. It adds the handler for the Business Metrics policy and the supporting extraction and reporting capabilities.</p>
<p>Requires the Network Director or Policy Manager Services feature.</p>
<p>If Network Director and Envision are installed in separate containers, install the Akana Envision Metrics Collector in the container where Network Director is installed.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration:</strong></p>
<p>No configuration required.</p>

<h4 id="ev_install_02_02">Akana Envision Policy Manager Console Extensions</h4>
<p>The Envision Console Extensions plug-in installs extensions to the Policy Manager Management Console to direct the collection of business metrics and SLA information. The information is then fed into the Envision product. The extensions include configuration screens for the policies relating to business metrics and SLA.</p>
<p>This plugin is installed on a container with the Akana Policy Manager Console feature. It adds the user interface for the Business Metrics policy and the Business QoS (SLA) Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration:</strong></p>
<p>This plugin has only one configuration setting which is the same as the Akana MongoDB Support plugin: see <a href="../../ag/analytics/api_gateway_analytics.htm#s04_01">Akana MongoDB Support Plugin</a>.</p>

<h4 id="ev_install_02_03">Akana Envision Service Extensions</h4>
<p>This plug-in installs connectors that Policy Manager uses for collection of business metrics and SLA collection that are then fed into the Envision product. This feature must be installed into the Policy Manager container instance and works in conjunction with Akana Envision. This plug-in also automatically installs the Envision Metrics Collector plug-in.
</p>
<p>This plugin is installed on a container with the Akana Policy Manager Services (Management and Security) and/or Policy Manager Jobs features. It adds the metrics API replacement that supports business metrics and storage in the MongoDB NoSQL database as well as the SLA Engine extension for Business QoS Policies.</p>
<p>Installs the following policies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../ev_policies/policy_op_business_metrics.htm">Business Metrics Policy</a> to the <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational</strong> section.</li>
<li><a href="../ev_policies/policy_op_business_service_level.htm"> Business Service Level Policy</a> to the <strong>Policies &gt; QoS</strong> section.</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature requires the Policy Manager Console feature.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration:</strong></p>
<p>This plugin has only one configuration setting which is the same as the Akana MongoDB Support plugin: see <a href="../../ag/analytics/api_gateway_analytics.htm#s04_01">Akana MongoDB Support Plugin</a>.</p>

<h4 id="ev_install_02_04">Akana Policy Manager Security Provider for Envision</h4>
<p>This plugin is installed on a container with the Akana Policy Manager Services and Envision feature. It installs the security plugin for protecting API Gateway collected operational metrics.</p>
<p>This plugin has no configuration.</p>

<h4 id="ev_install_02_05">Akana Sample Datasets for Demo Charts</h4>
<p>This optional plugin installs sample datasets for use in the Envision Console. See <a href="using_sample_data_sets_for_demo_charts.htm">Using the Akana Sample Datasets for Demo Charts Feature</a>.</p>
