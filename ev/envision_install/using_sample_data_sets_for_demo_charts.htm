<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This plug-in provides a series of sample datasets for demo charts that can be installed to the <strong>Envision Console</strong>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>When you install a sample dataset, the associated Widget and Dashboard are added to the Envision Console.</li>
	<li>These datasets provide you with a good starting point for becoming familiar with the Envision product and generating sample charts.</li>
	<li>The sample datasets can also be selected and used in the Business Metrics Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Installation of the <strong>Akana Envision</strong> feature is required to view and use the sample datasets in the <strong>Envision Console</strong> and in the <strong>Business Metrics Policy</strong>, but you can install the <strong>Akana Sample Datasets for Demo Charts</strong> feature and connect to the MongoDB database without pre-installing the <strong>Akana Envision</strong> feature.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Log into the <strong>Akana Administration Console</strong> of the target installation container instance using your default credentials.</li>
	<li>On the <strong>Available Features</strong> screen, select <strong>Plug-ins</strong> from the <strong>Filter</strong> menu.</li>
	<li>Select the <strong>Akana Sample Datasets for Demo Charts</strong> plug-in and click <strong>Install Feature</strong>.</li>
	<li>After the installation is complete, click <strong>Configure</strong> and continue.</li>
	<li>If the <strong>Akana Envision</strong> feature or <strong>Akana MongoDB Support</strong> plugin have <strong>not</strong> yet been installed, the <strong>Configure MongoDB Database</strong> screen will display. Here you will specify the <strong>MongoClientURI</strong> to connect to the database. If these features have been previously installed, this means you are already connected to the database, this screen will not display, and you can skip to the next step.</li>
	<li>On the <strong>Configure Sample Datasets</strong> screen, select the checkbox for each dataset you would like to install. The Operational Metrics and Shoe Sales Datasets and Charts are installed by default as part of the Akana Envision feature installation; dataset options are checked by default. 
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Operational Metrics Policy, which the Operational Metric dataset uses, is deprecated in version 2020.1.1. Do not use the Operational Metric dataset. Instead, create a new dataset and use the Business Metrics policy.</p></li>
	<li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong> to restart the container. Click <strong>Close</strong> after the container is restart is completed.</li>
	<li>After the installation is complete, you can manage (install / uninstall) datasets via the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab by selecting <strong>Configure Sample Datasets</strong>.</li>
