<h3>MongoDB limitation on size of index entries / workaround</h3>
<p>When a data set is defined in Envision, accompanying collections are generated in the MongoDB <strong>METRIC_RAW_DATA</strong> and <strong>METRIC_ROLLUP_DATA</strong> databases.</p>
<p>These collections will include generated indexes with names of the format <strong>&lt;data set name&gt; UIDX</strong>, and will consist of all dimensions defined for the data set.</p>
<p>MongoDB restricts the size of entries in such indexes to less than 1024 bytes; it is possible that records collected for the data set will exceed this limit, and if that happens those records will not be written to the collection.</p>
<p>Because of this limitation, it might be necessary to modify the MongoDB <strong>&lt;data set name&gt; UIDX</strong><strong></strong> indexes for a data set that has many (or lengthy) dimensions to include only those dimensions that will be used often in Envision charts defined on the data set.</p>
<p>Envision support for the API Platform provides a pre-defined data set called <strong>API Operational Metrics Data Set</strong>. When an Operational Metrics policy is defined that selects many or all dimensions, there is a possibility that the metrics records that are collected might exceed the Mongo index limit for the <strong>API Operational Metrics Data SetUIDX</strong> indexes on the <strong>API Operational Metric Data Set</strong> collections in the <strong>METRIC_RAW_DATA</strong> and <strong>METRIC_ROLLUP_DATA</strong> databases.</p>
<p>If this happens, the indexes should be manually updated to exclude dimensions that are not critical to chart performance.</p>
