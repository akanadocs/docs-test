<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the previous topic we introduced the concept of a data set, how metrics are defined, their aggregation, and collection intervals. In this topic we will describe how the data in a data set is actually collected and how the aggregation is performed.</p>



<h2 id="data_collection_using_a_broker">Data Collection Using a Broker</h2>
<p>Envision on its own does not collect data. It only aggregates data based on the data set definition. It does, however, provide an API that other systems and products can use to report the data they have collected that belong to a data set. Envision also provides an API for defining the data set itself so a system or product can create a data set in Envision and then start reporting data that belongs to that data set.</p>
<p>Other Akana products, when integrated with Envision, will install their own data sets and will collect data and feed it to Envision. The Akana API Gateway product will allow users to define metrics collection policies that are configured to extract data from business transactions that are processed by the API Broker. The policy defines instructions to the broker on how to extract information from a transaction and map it to a metric or dimension of a data set in Envision.</p>

<h2 id="data_collection_using_individual_transations_or_raw_data">Data Collection Using Individual Transactions or Raw Data</h2>
<p>The Envision API will accept data from individual transactions (<strong>raw</strong> data) or pre-aggregated data. The API will persist the data in a MongoDB document data store. From here Envision will instruct the data store to aggregate the stored data on intervals that match those defined in the data set. For example, if the data set is defined to provide daily and weekly metrics then Envision will instruct the data store to aggregate the metrics on a daily and weekly basis.</p>
<p>The calculations performed by the data store to aggregate the metrics are dictated by Envision. Envision will consult the data set definition and instruct the data store to perform the correct aggregation calculations. If the data store is clustered, or sharded, these calculations can span multiple instances providing the scalability that may be required for large volumes of data.</p>
