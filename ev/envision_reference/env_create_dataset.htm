<h2><a id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the previous topics we described the concept of a dataset. In this chapter we will describe how a dataset is created in the Envision product.</p>
<h2><a id="data_sets"></a>Datasets</h2>
<p>When you log into Envision you are presented with a top level menu consisting of <strong>DASHBOARDS</strong>, <strong>CHARTS</strong>, and <strong>DATASETS</strong>. Select the <strong>DATASETS</strong> menu item.</p>
<p><img src="images/env_creating_dataset1.jpg" alt="Envision" title="DATASETS menu on Envision Console" /></p>
<p>You are then presented three lists of datasets, My, Favorites, and Shared.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>My</strong>&#8212;Datasets that the logged in user has created. </li>
	<li><strong>Shared</strong>&#8212;Datasets that others have created and made available to the user. </li>
	<li><strong>Favorites</strong>&#8212;Datasets are those selected by the user to (either their own or someone else's) to be in the list. It provides a faster lookup of commonly used items by giving them their own list.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="create_new_data_set"></a>Create New Dataset</h3>
<p>Select <strong>New Dataset</strong> to start the process of creating a new dataset. A pop-up will be displayed where you can enter a name, a description, and designate how it will be shared.</p>
<p><img src="images/env_creating_dataset2.jpg" alt="Envision" title="New Dataset Pop-up" /></p>

<h3><a id="dataset_options"></a>Dataset Options</h3>
<p>A dataset can be shared with other users. When a dataset is shared users who are not the author can view the dataset and build charts against it. They cannot change the dataset. The dataset will automatically be placed in the My datasets list. If the <strong>Marked as Favorite</strong> checkbox is checked it will also be placed in the Favorites datasets list.</p>
<p>Each dataset card in a list has a pull-down menu of options that can be performed on the dataset.</p>
<p><img src="images/env_creating_dataset3.jpg" alt="Envision" title="Create Dataset Options" /></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Edit</strong>&#8212;Displays the pop-up used to create the dataset initially so that changes can be made. </li>
	<li><strong>Copy</strong>&#8212;Creates a copy of the dataset. The same pop-up will be displayed once again but this time it will before a new dataset and all the information from the copied dataset is filled in.</li>
	<li><strong>Favorite /Unfavorite</strong>&#8212;Can be used to toggle whether the dataset should be placed in the Favorites list. </li>
	<li><strong>Delete</strong>&#8212;Removes the dataset from the system. If any charts exist that use the dataset an error will be displayed to avoid breaking any dependent charts.</li>
</ul>
<p>To define the details of a dataset such as metrics and dimensions, select the name of the dataset on the dataset card. The dataset details page displays. The page is divided into three sections, <strong>Dimensions</strong>, <strong>Metrics</strong>, and <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<h2><a id="dimensions"></a>Dimensions</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dimensions</strong> section lists all the dimensions for the dataset. Dimensions are the properties of a dataset you use to query or organize metrics by. They provide the basis for how many combinations of aggregations will be made.</p>
<p><img src="images/env_creating_dataset4.jpg" alt="Envision" title="Dimensions" /></p>

<h3><a id="add_new_dimension"></a>Add New Dimension</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Each dataset is created initially with a single default dimension, <strong>timestamp</strong>. </li>
	<li>The timestamp dimension will group all metrics collected with a timestamp within the same collection time interval. </li>
	<li>The dimension can be deleted if you are not interested in time based aggregations but there must be at least one Date dimension for aggregation over time to function properly. </li>
</ul>
<p>To add another dimension, select <strong>New Dimension</strong>. A pop-up displays where you can enter a name, a description, a type, a default value (if any), and if the dimension is required or not.</p>
<p><img src="images/env_creating_dataset5.jpg" alt="Envision" title="Add New Dimension" /></p>
<p><strong>Note: At least one Dimension must be defined per dataset.</strong></p>

<h3><a id="dimension-options"></a>Dimension Options</h3>
<p>Dimensions can be one of the following types: Date, String, ID-Name, IP-Address, and Location.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The ID-Name type is a dual valued property with both an ID and a name. For example, if integrating with Policy Manager a dimension may be an organization. </li>
	<li>An organization in Policy Manager has an ID and a descriptive name. </li>
	<li>The engine will group metrics using the organization's ID. But when displaying choices of organizations in the Envision UI the organization names will be displayed to the user since they won't likely know the IDs. </li>
	<li>The Location type is a property that can reference a city, state, zip code, country, or geolocation (latitude/longitude).</li>
</ul>
<p>If a Default is specified, any dataset row that does not have the dimension will have the dimension added with the default value. The default value must be of the same type as the dimension. If the dimension is classified as required any collector of data MUST include the dimension or the data will not aggregate correctly and charts will likely not work well.</p>
<p>Each dimension in the list has a pull-down menu of options that can be performed on the dimension.</p>
<p><img src="images/env_creating_dataset6.jpg" alt="Envision" title="Dimension Options" /></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Edit</strong>&#8212;Displays the pop-up used to create the dimension initially so that changes can be made (excluding the name which cannot be changed). </li>
	<li><strong>Delete</strong>&#8212;Removes the dimension from the dataset. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="metrics"></a>Metrics</h2>
<p>The <strong>Metrics</strong> section lists all the metrics for the dataset. Metrics are the properties of a dataset that can be measured, aggregated, and compared.</p>
<p><img src="images/env_creating_dataset7.jpg" alt="Envision" title="Metrics" /></p>

<h3><a id="add_new_metric"></a>Add New Metric</h3>
<p>Each dataset is created initially with a single default metric, <strong>RequestCount</strong>. The RequestCount metric is the measure for the number of transactions, or orders in this example. The metric can be deleted if you do not wish to collect it.</p>
<p>To add another metric select <strong>New Metric</strong>. A pop-up displays where you can enter a name, a description, a type, and a set of aggregation calculations to perform.</p>
<p><img src="images/env_creating_dataset8.jpg" alt="Envision" title="Add New Metric" /></p>
<p>Metrics can be one of the following types: Count, Time, Size, Number, and Currency. The aggregation choices are average, sum, minimum, maximum, first, and last.</p>

<h3><a id="metrics_options"></a>Metrics Options</h3>
<p>Each metric in the list has a pull-down menu of options that can be performed on the metric.</p>
<p><img src="images/env_creating_dataset9.jpg" alt="Envision" title="Metric Options" /></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Edit</strong>&#8212;Displays the pop-up used to create the metric initially so that changes can be made (excluding the name which cannot be changed). </li>
	<li><strong>Delete</strong>&#8212;Removes the metric from the dataset. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Settings</strong> section lists all the aggregation and storage intervals for the dataset.</p>
<p><img src="images/env_creating_dataset10.jpg" alt="Envision" title="Metric Options" /></p>
<p>Envision supports aggregating metrics every minute, hour, day, week, month, and/or year. For each of these aggregation sets you can also specify how long the results should be held in the data store. This is done by selecting the a unit of time (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years) and a number of units.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For example in the image above the metrics will be aggregated on a weekly and monthly basis. </li>
	<li>The weekly results will be held in the data store for 1 year and the monthly results will be held in the data store for 5 years. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to think about how these intervals will limit the ability to make charts. It is not possible to create a chart with data points more granular than the aggregations calculated. Once again in our example you could not create a chart that shows metrics for shoe orders per minute or day.</p>
