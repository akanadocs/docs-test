<h2 id="ev_building_chart_overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Envision enables users to create a plethora of different charts that help visualize critical business data. With all of the possible configurations it may be overwhelming to new users. This guide helps explain common scenarios and best practices to build informative high performance charts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time series data with drill-down</li>
<li>Multiple Chart overlays</li>
<li>User adjustable filters</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p>



<h2 id="ev_building_chart_s01">Choosing a Time Interval</h2>
<p>The first choices you must make when designing a chart is where the data comes from (DataSet) and what time interval/window you want to use. The time interval can be thought of as how granular you need to see your statistics. This time interval granularity is a critical part of the performance of a chart. The finer grained granularity (ex: minutes) the more data that needs to be searched over a time period. Envision empowers users with the ability to view business data over large time periods rapidly using coarse grained granularity (ex: years, months) while enabling drill-down into finer granularity to see trends over weeks, days, hours, and/or minutes.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Start your charts with a coarse granular time interval: Year or Month. Then define drill-down to Week and further drill-down charts for Days, Hours, and Minutes as necessary.</p>

<h2 id="ev_building_chart_s02">Selecting your Data Grouping</h2>
<p>After choosing your dataset and time interval you'll be selecting the data grouping. In your data grouping you select which dimensions your chart is visualizing. This data grouping is tightly coupled with the chart visualization you're building. Grouping is an important concept to understand when building charts. The more dimensions you select in your grouping the more unique data points you'll be looking at. A chart type must be selected that can provide a useful visualization of the chosen grouping.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Compare Product Segment Sales against each other over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Group By: Product Segment, Timestamp</li>
<li>Chart Type: Bar Chart</li>
<li>Series Accumulator: Sales Subtotal, SUM</li>
</ul>
<p>You would not want to use this grouping with a Pie Chart as the visualization will include too many data points to visualize in a pie chart. To use a pie chart, you would be answering the question slightly differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group By: Product Segment</li>
<li>Filter: Last Year</li>
<li>Chart Type: Pie Chart</li>
<li>Series Accumulator: Sales Subtotal, SUM</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="ev_building_chart_s03">Selecting Filters</h2>
<p>The next option for your chart is a set of data filters. Also every chart will have at least one filter, on timestamp. A timestamp filter helps focus the data on what is relevant to the user and influences the performance of the chart. It is recommended to always keep the timestamp filter that deterministically defines a time range of data that will be visualized. For example, if you want to show a sales trend over the last week, a timestamp filter applied as the 1 week to the current date will ensure the chart is always (deterministically) displaying the most recent 7 days of sales data.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Filter by timestamp over a time period that is less than the next aggregation. For example, if you're looking at Month time intervals, filter over the most recent 12 months. If you want to look at more than a years worth of data, step up to a Year time interval. Just add additional charts to enable drill-down to week, day, hour, and minute time intervals when users need to see more detailed information over specific time periods.</p>
<p>In addition to the timestamp filter, additional filters may be used to focus on specific dimensions. This is useful for many scenarios, one example is visualizing the sales trends of a specific product (instead of all products together).</p>

<h2 id="ev_building_chart_s04">Choosing the Chart Visualization {<span class="apidoc_red">MDL: not sure about the hierarchy of these three subheads</span>}</h2>
<p>Chart types allow you to visualize data in a way that makes the most sense to you. You can easily experiment with different chart types to get the exact look you need to communicate the data effectively.</p>


<h3 id="ev_building_chart_s04_01">Drilldown</h3>
<p>Within the chart selection you'll also notice the drill-down form element this guide mentions regularly. This is how you define where the chart goes if a user clicks on a chart data element. You will use this often to define charts that enable users to dig into specific data points.a</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Finish building your high-level chart before playing around with the drilldown options. You'll need to build a second chart for the drilldown to load and it is best to have saved your high-level chart before building your drilldown chart.</p>


<h3 id="ev_building_chart_s04_02">X-Axis</h3>
<p>The X-Axis configuration is only defined for some chart types. For example, a pie chart has no X-axis to configure. If you need to define an X-Axis select the dimension of your aggregation you'd like to see across this axis. Often, users want to see data plotted over time, but don't be afraid to experiment with other combinations.</p>


<h3 id="ev_building_chart_s04_03">Series</h3>
<p>The series-N configurations are where you define what metrics you're going to be visualizing. You can use filters and multiple series to visualize competing data against each other. You can select different accumulators (sum, average, minimum, maximum) operators depending on what data is important to your visualization.</p>

<h2 id="ev_building_chart_s05">Examples (TODO â†’ Move to Tutorial for Each)</h2>
<p>Start with a question you want to answer, then imagine the chart visualization that would answer this question. Now you're equipped to start designing the desired chart in Envision.</p>

<h4>Identify Sale Performance Trends (Drill-down)</h4>
<p>Here we want to see sales totals over time for all product segments.</p>
<p>Dataset:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Interval: Month</li>
	<li>Group by: Product Segment, Timestamp</li>
	<li>Filters: Timestamp, Last 12 months</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;todo&gt;</p>

<h4>Compare Vendor Performance (Overlay)</h4>
<p>Overlay vendor specific sales on top of total sales to see how different vendors are driving total sales revenue.</p>
<p>&lt;todo&gt;</p>

<h4>Review Campaign Performance in a Specific City (User Define Filter)</h4>
<p>When the business runs a geographically specific business campaign, the analysts want to track the sales impact for that specific city. Their dashboard has a chart with sales activity for their current city, they can quickly update the filter to focus on cities where they are running active campaigns.</p>
