<h2 id="ev_building_chart_overview">Overview</h2>
<p>With Envision, you can create many different charts that help visualize critical business data. With all of the possible configurations, it could be difficult to know where to start with designing charts. This guide helps explain common scenarios and best practices to build informative high performance charts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time series data with drill-down</li>
<li>Multiple chart overlays</li>
<li>User-adjustable filters</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="ev_building_chart_s01">Choosing a Time Interval</h2>
<p>The first choices you must make when designing a chart determine these two key factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the data comes from (dataset).</li>
<li>The time interval/window you want to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding the time interval, think about the level of granularity you need in your statistics. This time interval granularity is a critical part of the performance of a chart. A finer the level of granularity, as represented by a smaller time interval (for example, minutes) means that more data must be searched over a time period. For example, of course, a one-day period represented with a time interval of hours has 24 data points; the same time period, with a time interval of minutes, has 1440 data points.</p>
<p>Envision empowers users with the ability to view business data over large time periods rapidly using coarse-grained granularity (for example, years or months), while enabling drill-down into finer granularity to see trends over weeks, days, hours, and/or minutes.</p>
<p>For instructions on determining the time interval in a chart, see <a href="env_create_chart.htm">Creating a Chart</a>.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Start your charts with a coarse granular time interval: Year or Month. Then define drill-down to Week and further drill-down charts for Days, Hours, and Minutes as necessary.</p>

<h2 id="ev_building_chart_s02">Selecting your Data Grouping</h2>
<p>After choosing your dataset and time interval, the next step is to select the data grouping. In the data grouping, you specify the dimensions that your chart is visualizing. This data grouping is tightly coupled with the chart visualization you're building.</p>
<p>Grouping is an important concept to understand when building charts. The more dimensions you select in your grouping, the more unique data points you'll be looking at. It's important to choose a chart type that can provide a useful visualization of the chosen grouping.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Let's say you want to design a chart that shows Product Segment Sales against each other over time. You could choose these values:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group By</strong>: Product Segment, Timestamp</li>
<li><strong>Chart Type</strong>: Bar Chart</li>
<li><strong>Series Accumulator</strong>: Sales Subtotal, SUM</li>
</ul>
<p>You would not want to use this grouping with a Pie Chart, because the visualization will include too many data points to visualize in a pie chart. If you want a pie chart, you might answer the question slightly differently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group By</strong>: Product Segment</li>
<li><strong>Filter</strong>: Last Year</li>
<li><strong>Chart Type</strong>: Pie Chart</li>
<li><strong>Series Accumulator</strong>: Sales Subtotal, SUM</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="ev_building_chart_s03">Selecting Filters</h2>
<p>The next option for your chart is a set of data filters. In addition, every chart has at least one filter, on timestamp. A timestamp filter helps focus the data on what is relevant to the user, and influences the performance of the chart. It is best to always keep the timestamp filter that deterministically defines a time range of data that will be visualized.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to show a sales trend over the last week, a timestamp filter applied as the <strong>1 week to the current date</strong> will ensure the chart always (deterministically) displays the most recent 7 days of sales data.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Filter by timestamp over a time period that is less than the next aggregation. For example, if you're looking at Month time intervals, filter over the most recent 12 months. If you want to look at more than a year's worth of data, step up to a Year time interval. If you need to see more detailed information over specific time periods, just define additional charts to enable drill-down to week, day, hour, and minute time intervals.</p>
<p>In addition to the timestamp filter, you can use additional filters to focus on specific dimensions. This is useful for many scenarios; for example, visualizing the sales trends of a specific product, rather than of all products together.</p>

<h2 id="ev_building_chart_s04">Choosing the Chart Visualization</h2>
<p>Chart types allow you to visualize data in a way that makes the most sense to you. You can easily experiment with different chart types to get the exact look you need to communicate the data effectively. Consider:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#ev_building_chart_s04_01">Drilldown</a></li>
	<li><a href="#ev_building_chart_s04_02">X-Axis</a></li>
	<li><a href="#ev_building_chart_s04_03">Series</a></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="ev_building_chart_s04_01">Drilldown</h3>
<p>Within the chart selection, you'll also notice the drill-down form element this guide mentions regularly. This is how you define where the chart goes if a user clicks on a chart data element. You will use this often to define charts that enable users to drill down into specific data points.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Finish building your high-level chart before playing around with the drilldown options. You'll need to build a second chart for the drilldown to load, and it's best to finish working with the high-level chart before building the drilldown chart.</p>


<h3 id="ev_building_chart_s04_02">X-Axis</h3>
<p>The X-axis configuration is defined for some chart types, but is not applicable to others. For example, a pie chart has no X-axis to configure. If you need to define an X-axis, select the dimension of the aggregation you'd like to see across this axis.</p>
<p>Often, users want to see data plotted over time. However, don't be afraid to experiment with other combinations.</p>


<h3 id="ev_building_chart_s04_03">Series</h3>
<p>The series-N configurations are where you define the metrics that will be represented in the chart. You can use filters and multiple series to visualize groups of data that compete  against each other. Depending on what data is important to your visualization, you can select different accumulators (sum, average, minimum, or maximum operators).</p>

<h2 id="ev_building_chart_s05">Examples</h2>
<p>Start with a question you want to answer, and then imagine the chart visualization that would answer this question. With this in mind, you're equipped to start designing the desired chart in Envision. If you're having difficulty, try sketching it out on paper.</p>
<p>This section includes some sample scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#ev_building_chart_s05_01">Identify Sale Performance Trends (Drill-down)</a></li>
<!--<li><a href="#ev_building_chart_s05_02">Compare Vendor Performance (Overlay)</a></li>-->
<li><a href="#ev_building_chart_s05_03">Review Campaign Performance in a Specific City (User Define Filter)</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ev_building_chart_s05_01">Identify Sale Performance Trends (Drill-down)</h4>
<p>Here we want to see sales totals over time for all product segments.</p>
<p>Dataset:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Interval: Month</li>
	<li>Group by: Product Segment, Timestamp</li>
	<li>Filters: Timestamp, Last 12 months</li>
</ul>

<!--<h4 id="ev_building_chart_s05_02">Compare Vendor Performance (Overlay)</h4>
<p>Overlay vendor-specific net sales profit (sales revenue minus material cost) different vendors are driving total sales profits. (to do)</p>-->

<h4 id="ev_building_chart_s05_03">Review Campaign Performance in a Specific Region (User-Defined Filter)</h4>
<p>When the business runs a geographically specific business campaign, the analysts want to track the sales impact for that specific region. Their dashboard has a chart with sales activity for their current region. They can quickly update the filter to focus on regions where they are running active campaigns.</p>
<p>In designing a chart to show this information, consider that if you use the IP address itself to identify location, there are potentially more than four billion data points&#8212;for IPv4, the pool is 4,294,967,296 possible combinations.</p>
<p>Instead, you could use a lookup against an IP address database to map a region code. Depending on the nature of the dataset, you might use continent, with seven data points, or, if the sales are US-only, you might use State, with 50 data points. This is much more efficient in terms of performance.</p>
<p>In an example using region, the dataset would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interval: Month</li>
<li>Group by: Region</li>
<li>Filters: Timestamp, Last 12 months</li>
</ul>
