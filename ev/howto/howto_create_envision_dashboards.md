##Introduction

Working charts are collected and organized for presentation to Envision users in **Dashboards**. 

* A Dashboard is simply a web page that will display 0 or more functional Charts.
* A Dashboard is **not for editing** Charts, but rather for **displaying** their **results**.

**Note**:

* If a Chart includes interactive Filters, those filters will be functional from within the Dashboard.

##Configuration Options

This section provides summary descriptions of all elements included in the various screens included under the Envision Console's *Dashboards* tab.

###The Dashboards Tab Initial Screen
When you click on the *Dashboards* tab, you are presented with:

* A drop-down menu presenting all Dashboard marked as "Favorites" available for selection.  Selecting a Dashboard here will display that Dashboard in *Live Mode*. 
* A **Configure** button which, when clicked, takes you to the *Dashboards Configuration* screen. 

###Dashboards in Live Mode
A Dashboard accessed via the drop-down (i.e. "Favorites") menu that's displayed upon initial access of the *Dashbaords* tab is presented in *Live Mode* where: 
 
  * Charts cannot be re-positioned or resized. 
  * If a chart was configured to display filters to users, the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner of the chart can be selected to access those filters.
  * Changes to values and filters can be reflected in the display by clicking the **Update** button.

###The Dashboards Configuration Screen
The *Dashboards Configuration* screen, accessed by clicking on the **Configure** button displayed upon initial access of the *Dashboards* tab, contains the following elements:  

* Three Dashboards **Folders**:  
  * **My** - Dashboards that the currently logged in user has created.
  * **Shared** - Dashboards that others have created and made available to the user.
  * **Favorites** -  Dashboards (**created by** either the currently logged in user or other users) collected by the current user into a single list. Favorite Dashboards are included in the drop-down menu displayed upon initial access of the *Dashboard* tab.   
* A *Filter By* section where you can enter a **Search** term by which to filter (i.e. limit) the dashboards that are displayed in the currently selected folder.   
* The list of currently configured Dashboards, as prescribed by the folder you have selected and the filter you have applied (if any), represented as **Dashboard Cards**.  
* The **New Dashboard** button which, when clicked, launches a *New Dashboard* pop up window.

###Dashboard Cards on the Dashboards Configuration Screen
Each Dashboard listing displayed on the *Configure Dashboards* Screen is represented by a "Dashboard card."  Each card includes the following elements:

* **Dashboard Name** which is also a link that, when clicked on, takes you to that Dashboard (non-live mode).
* **Dashboard Owner** and **Sharing Status** (i.e. public or private)
* **Dashboard Functions Drop-Down menu** (edit, copy, (un)favorite and delete)

###Dashboards Accessed from the Dashboards Configuration Screen
When you access a Dashboard by clicking on a **Dashboard Name** on a *Dashboard Card* in the *Configure Dashboards* section of the *Dashboards* tab, the following actions are available:

* **Resize** charts on the Dashboard
* **Position** charts on the Dashboard
* **Filter** and **Update** charts on the Dashboard
* **Export** a chart to either the printer or as a file (as a png, jpg, pdf or svg vector image)
