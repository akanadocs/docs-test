##Introduction

When you log into Envision you are presented with a top level menu consisting of *Dashboard*, *Charts*, and *Datasets*.

##Configuration Options

###The Datasets Tab  
When you click on the Datasets tab, you are presented with three Dataset lists:
  
* **My** - Datasets that the currently logged in user has created.
* **Favorites** -  Datasets that others have created and made available to the currently logged in user.
* **Shared** - Datasets that have been created by any user and have been designated as "Public."  Collecting Datasets in this list provides faster access to commonly used items by collecting them in a single, universally accessible location.

###Dataset Lists (e.g. *Shared*)
Each Dataset that's included in a list is represented by a "card" that includes a "functions" pull-down menu in its upper right hand corner.  Click the functions menu to reveal a list of actions that can be performed on the data set: 
 
* **Edit** - Launches the *Edit Dataset* pop up window where you can modify the Dataset's Name, Description, Sharing type, and whether or not it is a "Favorite."
* **Copy** - Launches the *Copy Dataset* pop up window where the current Dataset's attributes will be pre-populated and thus available for modification as part of creating a new dataset.
* **Favorite/Unfavorite** - Toggle whether the Dataset appears in the *Favorites* Dataset list.
* **Delete** - Remove the Dataset from the system.  
**Note**: *If any charts exist that use the Dataset, upon selecting ***Delete***, an error will be displayed to avoid breaking any dependent charts.*

###Dataset Sharing
Datasets can be configured to be either **Public** or **Private**:

* **Public** - Users who are not the author can view (but *not* change) the data set and build charts against it.
* **Private** - Only the author (i.e. creator) of this dataset can view and build charts against it.
