<p>##Introduction</p>

<p>Once a dataset has been created, a <strong>Chart</strong> can be created that will display the metrics collected for the data set.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>There are several kinds of Charts that are available in Envision. This page refers to concepts common to all charts.</em></li>
  <li><em>The options specific to each chart and examples of their use can be found in <a href="http://http://docs.akana.com/docs-test/ev/envision_reference/env_appendix.html">Envision Appendix</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
