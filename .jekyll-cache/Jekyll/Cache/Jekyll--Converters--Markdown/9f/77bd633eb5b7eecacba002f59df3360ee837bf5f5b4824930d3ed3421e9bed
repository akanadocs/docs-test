<p>##Introduction</p>

<p>Working charts are collected and organized for presentation to Envision users in <strong>Dashboards</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Dashboard is simply a web page that will display 0 or more functional Charts.</li>
  <li>A Dashboard is <strong>not for editing</strong> Charts, but rather for <strong>displaying</strong> their <strong>results</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a Chart includes interactive Filters, those filters will be functional from within the Dashboard.</li>
</ul>
