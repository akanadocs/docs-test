<h3><a name="about_certificate_authority"></a>About Certificate Authority</h3>
<p>A Certificate Authority (CA) is the Policy Manager CA Provider. The CA issues certificates and guarantees the validity of the binding between the certificate owner and its public key. The CA is a trusted authority, and any certificate issued by the CA identifies the owner of the certificate. Therefore, the private key that corresponds to the public key in the certificate is deemed to be known only by the specific owner.</p>
<p>Only one Certificate Authority can be configured. A Certificate Authority can be regenerated, renewed, deleted, or exported. When the Certificate Authority is generated, a serial number and Issuer DN is assigned. The Issuer DN will be the same as the Subject DN.</p>
<p>Two Certificate Authority options are supported: Policy Manager provides a simplified version of Certificate Authority that can issue and renew X.509 certificates, or one can be imported.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Policy Manager Certificate Authority is intended to be used in test environments for verifying features related to Policy Manager. For production environments, importing a formal CA is recommended (for example, VeriSign) that aligns with security policy requirements.</p>

<h4>Generate X.509 CA Certificate and PKI Keys</h4>
<p>The <strong>Generate CA Certificate and X.509 Certificate</strong> screen allows you to generate PKI Keys and an X.509 certificate. PKI Keys guarantee message integrity by signing the message with a private key and verifying the message with a public key. An X.509 certificate is an authentication mechanism that provides visibility to public information and verifies private information while keeping it secure. Credential Information is embedded in the body of a SOAP Message, or can be obtained from the HTTPS Context.</p>

<h3><a name="manage_cdp_options"></a>Manage CDP Options</h3>

<h4>About Managing CDP Options</h4>
<p>The <strong>Manage CDP Options</strong> function allows you to modify the Policy Manager Certificate Authority (CA) configuration to include the CRL Distribution Point (CDP), and specify a CRL Distribution Point URL.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Policy Manager Certificate Authority (CA) also issues a Certificate Revocation List (CRL). This CRL is stored at the CRL Distribution Point (CDP), which is the location where the latest Certificate Revocation List (CRL) can be downloaded.</li>
  <li>The CDP location can be accessed via a CRL Distribution Point URL which is a public URL where the certificate revocation list can be retrieved.</li>
  <li>This URL is generated by the Policy Manager C<strong>RL Distribution Point Service</strong>, located in Policy Manger under <strong>Workbench &gt; Services</strong>.</li>
  <li>The Certificate Distribution Point Options section includes a <strong>Modify CDP Options</strong> function that allows you to enable the inclusion of a CRL Distribution Point (CDP) and specify a CRL Distribution Point URL. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This option is disabled by default. In disabled mode, the certificates generated by the Policy Manager <strong>CRL Distribution Point Service</strong> will not have the CRL Distribution Point (CDP). This means that the link to the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) will not be accessible</li>
  <li>The CRL Distribution Point URL can be any name but must route to the Policy Manager <strong>CRL Distribution Point Service</strong>.</li>
  <li>If the Policy Manager Certificate Authority (CA) is deleted using the <a href="#delete_ca_certificate">Delete CA Certificate</a> function, the CDP Options are also deleted. If you use the <a href="#renew_ca_certificate">Renew CA Certificate</a> function, CDP Options that are configured will be retained.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Scenarios</h4>
<p><strong><strong>Policy Manager and certificates in same subnet:</strong></strong></p>
<p>When the Policy Manager installation and certificates generated by Policy Manager are in the same subnet, use the <strong>Modify CDP Options</strong> function with no additional steps.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Policy Manager and certificates in different subnet:</strong></strong></p>
<p>Access to a Policy Manager installation is restricted for a specific subnet. However, certificates generated by Policy Manager may be distributed to customers outside of that subnet. In this case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The certificates may include a URL to the Certificate Revocation List. This URL is called a CDP. </li>
  <li>The Policy Manager <strong>CRL Distribution Point Service</strong> must point to this URL. However, because you are trying to access a CRL Distribution Point Service that might be in a different subnet, you cannot use it directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>To resolve this access problem, you can set up a proxy server that publishes a URL that users can reach. This URL is then routed to the Policy Manager CRL Distribution Point Service URL by specifying the URL on the <strong>Manage CDP Options</strong> page.</p>

<h4>To Manage CDP Options</h4>
<p>Enable the Policy Manager Certificate Authority with Certification Revocation List functionality.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificates</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificate Authority</strong>. The <strong>Certificate Authority Summary</strong> screen displays. If the certificate authority is not yet generated, see <a href="#configure_certificate_authority">Configure Certificate Authority</a>.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Certificate Distribution Point Options</strong> section, click <strong>Manage CDP Options</strong>.<br />
The <strong>Manage CDP Options</strong> screen displays.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Include CRL Distribution Point</strong> checkbox. </li>
  <li>In the <strong>CRL Distribution Point URL</strong> field, specify a URL for the CRL.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.<br />
Your configuration changes appear in the <strong>Certificate Distribution Point Options</strong> section of the <strong>Certificate Authority Summary</strong> screen.</li>

<h3><a name="generate_ca_csr"></a>Generate CA CSR</h3>
<p>Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the Policy Manager certificate authority.</p>

<h4>About Certificate Signing Requests</h4>
<p>A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is a file that includes encoded information generated by a web server identifying the applicant and the public key chosen by the applicant. Before creating a CSR, the applicant first generates a key pair, keeping the private key secret. The corresponding private key is not included in the CSR, but is used to digitally sign the entire request.</p>
<p>A CSR file typically has a .CSR extension, but can have other extensions, based on the source application that generated the file. Policy Manager supports the PEM (which is a BASE64 encoded PKCS10) for Certificate Signing Requests.</p>
<p>A CSR is sent from an applicant to a Certificate Authority to request a digital certificate, such as an X.509 certificate, which can then be imported later to make the Policy Manager CA as a subordinate CA to the third-party Certificate Authority.</p>

<h4>To Generate a CA CSR</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificates</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificate Authority</strong>. The <strong>Certificate Authority Summary</strong> screen displays.<br />

<h3><a name="cert_expired_update"></a>Updating an expired certificate</h3>
<p>If the certificate for a container is expired, or close to expiration, the best way to update it is to get a new certificate. It's not necessary to update the private key in this scenario.</p>
<p>There are just a few steps in this process. The procedure below summarized these steps, with links for more detailed instructions.</p>
<h5>To update an expired certificate for a container</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the container. This results in an exported <strong>certificate.csr</strong> file.
    <p>In the Akana Administration Console for the container: <strong>Configuration</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Configuration Actions</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage PKI Keys</strong>. Under <strong>Key Management Options</strong>, choose <strong>Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR)</strong>, as shown below. For Policy Manager: see <a href="#generate_ca_csr">Generate CA CSR</a>. See <a href="http://docs.akana.com/sp/key_management/key_management.htm#gencertsignreq" target="_blank">Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR)</a>.  Note that you do not need to update the private key unless it's been compromised. A new certificate can reference the same key pair.</p>
    <p><img src="images/aac_manage_pki_keys_generatecsr.jpg"  alt="Manage PKI Keys: generate CSR" /></p>
    <p>When you complete the wizard, the <strong>certificate.csr</strong> file is saved to your default folder for downloads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Send the <strong>certificate.csr</strong> file to your Certificate Authority, or your security team. Once the signing process is complete, you'll receive a new certificate.</li>
  <li>Upload the new certificate for the container.
    <p>In the Akana Administration Console for the container: <strong>Configuration</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Configuration Actions</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage PKI Keys</strong>. Under <strong>Key Management Options</strong>, choose <strong>Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR)</strong>, as shown below. Choose Import X.509 certificate, browser for the certificate, and import it. </p>
<p><img src="images/aac_manage_pki_keys_importcert.jpg"  alt="Manage PKI Keys: import certificate" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>Refresh the metadata for your container. This is necessary for the new certificate to take effect.
    <p>In Policy Manager, on the right, choose <strong>Workbench</strong>. On the left select the container. On the right, under <strong>Actions</strong>, choose <strong>Update Container Metadata</strong>. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.akana.com/sp/container_management/container_management.htm#update_metadata" target="_blank">Update Container Metadata</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've completed the steps above, test to make sure that your container can communicate with the Network Director.</p>
