<h3><a name="id_systems_about"></a>About Identity Systems</h3>
<p>Identity management technologies provide tools for simplifying the management of data for users of an organization's information technology systems.</p>
<p>Identity management applications provide a method of storing data and making this data available to network users and administrators. Authentication Protocols provide authentication for client/server applications and validate the identity of a communicating entity. An identity management application is referred to as an &quot;Identity System.&quot; Each Identity System provides a method for storing data and making this data available to network users and administrators. Data is typically stored in what is called a &quot;Directory.&quot;</p>
<p>Data for a single user is stored in a user account. A user account includes values such as Name, Password, Phone Numbers. This information can be accessed by authorized users on the same network. User accounts can also be assigned to a group. This is referred to as a &quot;User Group&quot; or &quot;Group Account.&quot; Rights and permissions are assigned to the user group and members of the group assume these rights and permissions.</p>

<h3><a name="id_integration_about"></a>About Identity Integration</h3>
<p>The process of identity integration enables Policy Manager's Policy Manager Subsystem to authenticate with a third party identity system. The ability to connect to an enterprise organization's identity system significantly reduces the Policy Manager deployment time and increases the manageability of the security administration process.</p>
<p>Identity integration is established between Policy Manager, the client application, and a third-party identity system using a set of business rules. These business rules are called <strong>connector properties</strong>. Connector properties generally include configuration details for connecting to the host machine where the identity system resides, configuring the authentication method, and specifying user identity information (for example, user/user group name, description, attributes). These connector properties are packaged in an &quot;Identity System Option Pack.&quot;</p>
<p>When an identity system is successfully integrated with Policy Manager, a trust is established between the client application user and the Policy Manager Subsystem and a domain name is added to the drop-down list box on the Policy Manager <strong>Login</strong> Screen and on the <strong>User Groups Summary</strong> screen in <strong>Security &gt; User Groups</strong>. When a user who is present in the identity system directory logs into the Policy Manager &quot;Management Console,&quot; the Management Console authenticates with the identity system, then sends a request for a token to the Policy Manager Subsystem. Once this trust is established, access is granted to all Policy Manager functions based on assigned privileges.</p>
<p>Authentication credentials for identity system users that will be accessing Policy Manager are stored in the identity system. Policy Manager application users must be stored in the Policy Manager.</p>
<p>Policy Manager provides an <strong>Add Identity System Wizard</strong> that is used to add an Identity System to Policy Manager ( integrate) and to maintain the associated connection properties (modify and delete). This wizard is accessible via the <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Identity Systems</strong> section of the Management Console. Five types of identity systems are supported:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="ids_claims_based.html">Claims-based</a></li>
  <li><a href="ids_cookie_authentication_module.html">Cookie Authentication Module</a></li>
  <li><a href="ids_directory_server.html">Directory Server (Active Directory)</a></li>
  <li><a href="ids_kerberos.html">Kerberos</a></li>
  <li><a href="ids_saml.html">SAML</a></li>

<h3><a name="id_system_config_about"></a>About Identity System Configuration</h3>
<p>The <strong>Add Identity System Wizard</strong> provides a method of integrating your Identity Management Application or Authentication Protocol with Policy Manager through the use of &quot;Identity System Option Packs.&quot; Each Identity System Option Pack includes a set of connector properties and settings that must be configured to successfully integrate with Policy Manager.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:<br />
Two approaches are used for distributing option packs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They can be distributed separately as a Feature and installed using the <strong>Akana Administration Console</strong>.</li>
  <li>They can come pre-installed in a Policy Manager release. The distribution approach varies based on the Policy Manager release cycle. Installed option packs are accessible via a drop-down list box in the <strong>Add Identity System Wizard</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After Policy Manager is updated with a new Option Pack, the feature set for the associated identity system is integrated with the <strong>Add Identity System Wizard</strong>. This wizard is used to configure and maintain identity system domains to be integrated with Policy Manager.</p>
<p>When you add a new identity system to Policy Manager, the identity system domain is displayed in the <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Identity Systems</strong> section of the <strong>Policy Manager Management Console</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<h3><a name="id_system_config_options"></a>Configuration Options</h3>


<h4><a name="id_system_add"></a>Add Identity System</h4>
<p>The <strong>Add Identity System Wizard</strong> provides a series of options that are used to configure and maintain Identity Systems that you would like to integrate with Policy Manager.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: <br />
The number of identity systems available to select is based on how many &quot;Identity System Option Packs&quot; you have installed using the <strong>Akana Administration Console</strong> or have come pre-installed in your Policy Manager release.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<h3><a name="id_system_modify"></a>Modify Identity System</h3>
<p>Follow all steps outlined in the various <a href="#id_system_add">Add Identity System</a> instruction sets, except, in each case, substitute the following for step 2:</p>
<p>Click <strong>Modify Identity System</strong>. The <strong>Modify Identity System Wizard</strong> launches and displays the <strong>Identity System Domain Details</strong> screen.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<h3><a name="id_system_delete"></a>Delete Identity System</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Identity Systems</strong>.  
</li>
  <li>On the <strong>Identity Systems Summary</strong> screen, select the identity system you would like to delete. </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Delete Identity System</strong>.</li>
  <li>At the confirmation message, click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<h3><a name="change_domain_sequence"></a>Change Domain Sequence</h3>
<p>Update the display sequence of Identity System domains that are selectable from drop-down menus throughout Policy Manager. Used if your organization has integrated two or more identity system domains and you would like to configure the default menu selection for a specific Policy Manager deployment.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Identity Systems</strong>. The <strong>Identity Systems Summary</strong> screen displays. </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Change Domain Sequence</strong>. The <strong>Change Domain Sequence</strong> screen displays and presents the list of identity system domains in the current display sequence.</li>
  <li>Select the line item you would like to re-position and the use the <strong>Move Up</strong> and/or <strong>Move Down</strong> buttons to move its position in the list.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
</ol>
