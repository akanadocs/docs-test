## View Policy Manager Domain Name and Description
During the initial Policy Manager configuration process, the SOA Software Administration Console is used to define an instance of the Policy Manager and its associated Domain Name and Description. This name and description will be what *other* Policy Managers see when Trusted Domains are created between them.

To view a policy manager instance's domain name and description, go to **Configure > Security > Details**.
