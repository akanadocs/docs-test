<h2 id="certificates_about">Overview</h2>
<p>Policy Manager offers the following options for managing certificates, in <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Certificate Authority</strong>: Information about the platform as a Certificate Authority. See <a href="#certificates_pm">Policy Manager as a Certificate Authority</a> below.</li>
	<li><strong>Trusted CA Certificates</strong>: The Policy Manager <a href="../../cm/learnmore/basics_glossary.htm#gl_truststore">trust store</a>, which includes certificates from trusted <a href="../../cm/learnmore/basics_glossary.htm">Certificate Authorities</a> such as Verisign. See <a href="#certificates_trusted">Trusted CA Certificates: the Policy Manager Trust Store</a> below.</li>
	<li><strong>User Certificate Renewal</strong>: Allows you to configure a custom email to be sent to a user when the user certificate is about to expire or has expired. See <a href="#certificate_user_renewal">User Certificate Renewal</a> below.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<h2 id="certificates_trusted">Trusted CA Certificates: the Policy Manager Trust Store</h2>
<p>The Policy Manager <a href="../../cm/learnmore/basics_glossary.htm#gl_truststore">trust store</a> is the secure repository for trusted CA certificates uploaded to the platform.</p>
<p>If you want the Akana platform to trust a CA that's internal to your company, or an external CA such as Digicert, you must upload the certificate to the Policy Manager Trust store, so that the platform can successfully send messages to endpoints secured by a certificate signed by the CA. For example, let's say one of your services is a proxy  service to google.com. Google.com has a certificate issued by a CA. If that CA is not in the Policy Manager trust store, and you try to call the API, the platform will return an error because the endpoint is not trusted. In order for a call to a secure endpoint to be successful, the CA must be in Trusted CA Certificates.</p>
<p>In the Community Manager developer portal, you have the option to create an API by specifying a URL, for example for a WSDL or a Swagger document description file. If the endpoint is HTTPS, the CA that the endpoint is using must be in the Policy Manager trust store. If it is not, the platform will return an error and will not allow you to access the endpoint, since it is not secure. Part of setup is making sure that the CAs you will be using are in the trust store.</p>
<p>Navigation: <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificates</strong> &gt; <strong>Trusted CA Certificates</strong>.</p>
<p>There are two basic categories of certificates in the Policy Manager trust store:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Container certificates</strong>&#8212;Added automatically as a container gets registered or provisioned. When you register a Network Director or provision a container, the certificate for the container is automatically created and added to the trust store.</li>
	<li><strong>Trusted CA certificates that Akana needs to talk to HTTPS endpoints in the whole environment</strong>&#8212;Whether it's Network Director, Policy Manager, or the developer portal, when the platform reaches out to a secure endpoint, for the call to be successful, the CA must be in the Policy Manager trust store. <span class="apidoc_red">This could include a self-signed certificate: for example, in a scenario where an internal application is accessing internal APIs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You can manually add a CA certificate to the Policy Manager trust store in these ways: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Upload a trusted CA certificate file (.CER or .DER format) to the trust store (<strong>Add Trusted CA Certificate</strong> option)</li>
	<li>Import one or more trusted CA certificates from a Java or PKCS12 keystore file to the trust store (<strong>Import Trusted CA Certificates from Keystore</strong> option)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Certificate expiration</strong>&#8212;For information about the alerts that are generated when certificates in the Trust Store are getting close to their expiration dates, or have expired, see <a href="certificate_expiration.htm">Managing Certificate Expiration</a>.
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="certificates_user">User and Listener Certificates</h2>
<p>User certificates are not shown in the <strong>Certificates</strong> section of Policy Manager, since they are assigned at the level of the individual user. To assign a certificate to a user in Policy Manager, go to <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Users</strong>, choose the user, and click <strong>Manage PKI Keys</strong>. For information about using this wizard, including setting up the certificate details, see <a href="../../sp/admin_console/config_actions.htm#aac_ca_managepkikeys">Manage PKI Keys</a>.</p>
<p>You can view a user certificate in the context of the specific user, and a listener certificate in the context of the listener.</p>
<p>{<span class="apidoc_red">TJ: SH said: &quot;Shall I open another ATMO ticket for CA certificate and PM domain certificate?&quot; Do you know about PM domain certificate? Does that fall into the same category as above do you think?</span>}</p>

<h2 id="certificate_user_renewal">User Certificate Renewal</h2>
<p>The User Certificate Renewal option allows you to configure a custom email to be sent when the user certificate is about to expire or has expired.</p>
<p>Navigation: <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificates</strong> &gt; <strong>User Certificate Renewal</strong>.</p>
<p> In this context, the term user certificate applies to these categories of certificates:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Certificate for a login user</li>
	<li>Certificate associated with a service</li>
	<li>Listener certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not apply to Trusted CA Certificates.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="user_certificate_renewal.htm">User Certificate Renewal Configuration</a>.</p>
