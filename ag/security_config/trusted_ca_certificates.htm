<h2 id="trusted_ca_certificates_about">About Trusted CA Certificates</h2>
<p>A trusted CA certificate is a certificate generated by a <a href="../../cm/learnmore/basics_glossary.htm#gl_certificateauthority">Certificate Authority</a>, an external third-party company that is qualified with a specified level of trust.</p>
<p>Trusted CA Certificates that are imported into Policy Manager are displayed in the <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificates</strong> &gt; <strong>Trusted CA Certificates</strong> section, on the <strong>Trusted CA Certificates Summary</strong> page.</p>
<p>There are two basic categories of certificates in the Policy Manager trust store:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Container certificates</strong>&#8212;Added automatically as a container gets registered or provisioned. When you register a Network Director or provision a container, the certificate for the container is automatically created and added to the trust store.</li>
	<li><strong>Trusted CA certificates</strong>&#8212;Whether it's Network Director, Policy Manager, or the Community Manager developer portal, when the platform reaches out to a secure endpoint, for the call to be successful, the CA must be in the Policy Manager trust store. This could include a self-signed certificate: for example, in a scenario where an internal application is accessing internal APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can manually add a CA certificate to the Policy Manager trust store in these ways: </p>
<ul>
	
	<li>Upload a trusted CA certificate file to the trust store. See <a href="#trusted_ca_certificate_add">Add Trusted CA Certificates (CER or DER)</a>.</li>
	<li>Import one or more trusted CA certificates from a Java or PKCS12 keystore file to the trust store. See <a href="#trusted_ca_certificate_import">Import Trusted CA Certificates from Keystore</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Certificate expiration</strong>&#8212;For information about the alerts that are generated when certificates in the Trust Store are getting close to their expiration dates, or have expired, see <a href="certificate_expiration_alerts.htm">Managing Certificate Expiration</a>. </p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Trusted CA certificates are used when an identity is being validated as the entity it claims to be.</li>
	<li>Certificates imported into Policy Manager must be issued by a Trusted CA Authority.</li>
	<li>Trusted CA Certificates must be configured prior to importing X.509 certificates for Service, User, Container, or Management Console operations.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="trusted_ca_certificate_add">Add Trusted CA Certificates (CER or DER)</h2>
<p>If you want to add a new Trusted CA Certificate to the set that is already in the Policy Manager vault, you must create a Java keystore file that has all the Trusted CA Certificates plus the new one that you want to add to the Policy Manager vault. </p>
<p>For example, if the Policy Manager vault has trusted certificates A, B and C, and you want to add certificate D, the Java keystore file used during the update process must have certificates A, B, C and D.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As a prerequisite for configuring outbound HTTPS certificates, Trusted CA Certificates must be present. A default set of Trusted CA Certificates are added when the &quot;Policy Manager Services&quot; feature is installed using the Akana Administration Console. The &quot;Policy Manager Console&quot; feature must also be installed in order to access the Trusted CA Certificates functions through the Policy Manager Management Console.</p>

<h4>To add a trusted CA certificate (CER or DER)</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificates</strong> &gt;<strong>Trusted CA Certificates</strong>. The <strong>View Trusted CA Certificate</strong> page is displayed.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="trusted_ca_certificate_delete">Delete Trusted CA Certificates</h2>
<p>When you import a Trusted CA Certificate, all the Trusted CA Certificates in the Policy Manager vault are overwritten by the certificates that are in the Java keystore file being used. Based on this, if you want to delete a certificate from the set of Trusted CA Certificates that are in the Policy Manager vault, you must have a Java keystore file that has all the Trusted CA Certificates except the one that you want to delete from the Policy Manager vault, and use that Java keystore file during the update process. </p>
<p>For example, if the Policy Manager vault has Trusted CA Certificates A, B and C, and you want to delete certificate B, then the Java keystore file used during the update process must have certificates A and C.</p>

<h4>To delete a trusted CA certificate</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificates</strong> &gt;<strong>Trusted CA Certificates</strong>. The <strong>View Trusted CA Certificate</strong> screen displays.</li>
	<li>Click on the line item for the Trusted Certificate you want to delete.</li>
