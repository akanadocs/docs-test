<h2 id="privacy_about">About Privacy</h2>
<p>In Policy Manager, the <strong>User Name</strong>, <strong>Full Name</strong>, and <strong>Email</strong> personal information fields are searchable / visible (by default) in various areas of the Policy Manager Management Console. If you would like to apply additional security to these fields and make them &quot;private&quot; (not searchable in the Policy Manager Management Console), you can configure them to be encrypted using the <strong>Manage Privacy</strong> function.</p>
<p>To view a list of personal information fields that are encrypted, go to <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Privacy</strong> to access the <strong>Privacy Summary</strong> screen.</p>

<h2 id="privacy_manage">Manage Privacy</h2>
<p>Encrypt the <strong>User Name</strong>, <strong>Full Name</strong>, and <strong>Email</strong> fields so they are private and not searchable in the Policy Manager Management Console.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Privacy</strong>.
The <strong>Privacy Summary</strong> screen presents a list user information fields that can be selected for encryption.</li>
	<li>Click the check box next to each information field you would like to encrypt in the Policy Manager Management Console.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the confirmation message, click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the information fields you designated as private in steps 1&#8211;4 above, when you try to search for them in the various areas of the Policy Manager Management Console, your search will return zero results as the data will not be recognized because the fields are now encrypted.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong>, if you make the <strong>Full Name</strong> information field private, and then try to search for &quot;Full Name&quot; on the <strong>Manage Identities</strong> Screen, you would receive zero results.</p>
