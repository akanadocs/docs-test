<h2 id="about_certificate_authority">About Certificate Authority</h2>
<p>The Certificate Authority (CA) page allows you to configure the platform's Policy Manager CA Provider. The CA issues certificates and guarantees the validity of the binding between the certificate owner and its public key. The CA is a trusted authority, and any certificate issued by the CA identifies the owner of the certificate. Therefore, the private key that corresponds to the public key in the certificate is deemed to be known only by the specific owner.</p>
<p>Only one Certificate Authority can be configured. A Certificate Authority can be regenerated, renewed, deleted, or exported. When the Certificate Authority is generated, a serial number and Issuer DN is assigned. The Issuer DN will be the same as the Subject DN.</p>
<p>Two Certificate Authority options are supported: Policy Manager provides a simplified version of Certificate Authority that can issue and renew X.509 certificates, or one can be imported.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Policy Manager Certificate Authority is intended to be used in test environments for verifying features related to Policy Manager. For production environments, importing a formal CA is recommended (for example, VeriSign) that aligns with security policy requirements.</p>

<h3 id="proc_generate_cert_key">Generate X.509 CA Certificate and PKI Keys</h3>
<p>The <strong>Generate CA Certificate and X.509 Certificate</strong> screen allows you to generate PKI Keys and an X.509 certificate. PKI Keys guarantee message integrity by signing the message with a private key and verifying the message with a public key. An X.509 certificate is an authentication mechanism that provides visibility to public information and verifies private information while keeping it secure. Credential Information is embedded in the body of a SOAP Message, or can be obtained from the HTTPS Context.</p>

<h2 id="manage_cdp_options">Manage CDP Options</h2>

<h3>About Managing CDP Options</h3>
<p>The <strong>Manage CDP Options</strong> function allows you to modify the Policy Manager Certificate Authority (CA) configuration to include the CRL Distribution Point (CDP), and specify a CRL Distribution Point URL.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Policy Manager Certificate Authority (CA) also issues a Certificate Revocation List (CRL). This CRL is stored at the CRL Distribution Point (CDP), which is the location where the latest Certificate Revocation List (CRL) can be downloaded.</li>
	<li>The CDP location can be accessed via a CRL Distribution Point URL which is a public URL where the certificate revocation list can be retrieved.</li>
	<li>This URL is generated by the Policy Manager C<strong>RL Distribution Point Service</strong>, located in Policy Manager under <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Services</strong>.</li>
	<li>The Certificate Distribution Point Options section includes a <strong>Modify CDP Options</strong> function that allows you to enable the inclusion of a CRL Distribution Point (CDP) and specify a CRL Distribution Point URL.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>This option is disabled by default. In disabled mode, the certificates generated by the Policy Manager <strong>CRL Distribution Point Service</strong> will not have the CRL Distribution Point (CDP). This means that the link to the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) will not be accessible</li>
	<li>The CRL Distribution Point URL can be any name but must route to the Policy Manager <strong>CRL Distribution Point Service</strong>.</li>
	<li>If the Policy Manager Certificate Authority (CA) is deleted using the <a href="#delete_ca_certificate">Delete CA Certificate</a> function, the CDP Options are also deleted. If you use the <a href="#renew_ca_certificate">Renew CA Certificate</a> function, CDP Options that are configured will be retained.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scenarios</h3>
<p><strong>Policy Manager and certificates in same subnet:</strong></p>
<p>When the Policy Manager installation and certificates generated by Policy Manager are in the same subnet, use the <strong>Modify CDP Options</strong> function with no additional steps.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Manager and certificates in different subnet:</strong></p>
<p>Access to a Policy Manager installation is restricted for a specific subnet. However, certificates generated by Policy Manager may be distributed to customers outside of that subnet. In this case:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The certificates may include a URL to the Certificate Revocation List. This URL is called a CDP.</li>
	<li>The Policy Manager <strong>CRL Distribution Point Service</strong> must point to this URL. However, because you are trying to access a CRL Distribution Point Service that might be in a different subnet, you cannot use it directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>To resolve this access problem, you can set up a proxy server that publishes a URL that users can reach. This URL is then routed to the Policy Manager CRL Distribution Point Service URL by specifying the URL on the <strong>Manage CDP Options</strong> page.</p>

<h3>To Manage CDP Options</h3>
<p>Enable the Policy Manager Certificate Authority with Certification Revocation List functionality.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificates</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificate Authority</strong>. The <strong>Certificate Authority Summary</strong> screen displays. If the certificate authority is not yet generated, see <a href="#configure_certificate_authority">Configure Certificate Authority</a>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Certificate Distribution Point Options</strong> section, click <strong>Manage CDP Options</strong>.
		<p>The <strong>Manage CDP Options</strong> screen displays.</p></li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Include CRL Distribution Point</strong> checkbox.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>CRL Distribution Point URL</strong> field, specify a URL for the CRL.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.
		<p>Your configuration changes appear in the <strong>Certificate Distribution Point Options</strong> section of the <strong>Certificate Authority Summary</strong> screen.</p></li>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="generate_ca_csr">Generate CA CSR</h2>
<p>Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the Policy Manager certificate authority.</p>

<h3>About Certificate Signing Requests</h3>
<p>A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is a file that includes encoded information generated by a web server identifying the applicant and the public key chosen by the applicant. Before creating a CSR, the applicant first generates a key pair, keeping the private key secret. The corresponding private key is not included in the CSR, but is used to digitally sign the entire request.</p>
<p>A CSR file typically has a .CSR extension, but can have other extensions, based on the source application that generated the file. Policy Manager supports the PEM (which is a BASE64 encoded PKCS10) for Certificate Signing Requests.</p>
<p>A CSR is sent from an applicant to a Certificate Authority to request a digital certificate, such as an X.509 certificate, which can then be imported later to make the Policy Manager CA as a subordinate CA to the third-party Certificate Authority.</p>

<h3>To Generate a CA CSR</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificates</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificate Authority</strong>. The <strong>Certificate Authority Summary</strong> screen displays.
		<p><strong>Note</strong>: To renew a CA certificate, an existing CA certificate must already be defined.</p></li>
	<li>Click <strong>Generate CA CSR</strong>. The <strong>Generate CA Certificate Signing Request</strong> screen displays, showing a <strong>Certificate Signing Request Details</strong> section that includes the list of Subject Distinguished Name (DN) elements that comprise the CSR.</li>
	<li>Enter the CSR details based on your requirements:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Common Name (CN)</strong>&#8212;The owner name of the Certificate Authority (for example, Policy Manager Certificate Authority).</li>
	<li><strong>Organizational Unit (OU)</strong>&#8212;The group or department name of the owner of the Certificate Authority.</li>
	<li><strong>Organizational Name (O)</strong>&#8212;The name of the organization that owns the Certificate Authority.</li>
	<li><strong>Locality Name (L)</strong>&#8212;(Optional) The geographic region of the Organization that owns the Certificate Authority.</li>
	<li><strong>State Name (S)</strong>&#8212;The state of the organization that owns the Certificate Authority.</li>
	<li><strong>Country (C)</strong>&#8212;The country of the organization that owns the Certificate Authority.</li>
