<h3>Introduction</h3></a>


<p>The "API User Security Policy" is the default security policy  for Community Manager services and controls who can perform administrative actions on  the Community Manager portal.</p>
<p>When a user installs the "SOA Software Community Manager Policy  Console" and "SOA Software Community Manager" features, a series of  Community-specific services are added to the "Services" folder of the Community Manager Tenants" organization located in the "SOA Software Policy Manager"  organization. The "API User Security Policy" is automatically assigned to these  services during the  installation of the Community Manager features. You can  select <strong>View References</strong> on the Actions Portlet of the <em>Policy Details </em>page to view services that the policy is attached too, and can also view the policy attachment on the "Operational Policy Attachment Portlet" of any  of the Community Manager services.</p>
<p><em>Note: This service is for users  that have installed the SOA Software Community Manager Policy Console and SOA Software  Community Manager features.</em></p>
<p>In Community Manager, when you add an API using the <strong>Add a New API</strong> function, you  automatically become API Administrator for that API. You can also invite  individuals who you would like to give administrator privileges to your API via  the Community Manager <em>API &gt; Admins</em> interface. The API creator and approved administrators can access the API. </p>
<p>The "API User Security Policy" determines who the user is (i.e.,  administrator or standard user account). When a request comes to a Community Manager service, it is intercepted by the "API User Security Policy" before being  processed. The policy checks to determine if the user is logged in, and whether  the user is an administrator for the selected API or has a standard user  account. Depending on the action, if the user is not authorized to perform the  selected action, an error will be thrown or the option will be grayed out and  not available for selection.</p>
<h5>Configuration Options</h5>
<p>This policy type does not require any configuration. A default API User Security Policy   is  added to the <em>Policy Manager Management Console</em> as part of the Community Manager installation.

<h3>Configuration</h3></a>



<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the API User Security Policy configuration process to get your started.
</p>
<h5>Step 1: Review Policy (in Policy Manager Management Console)</h5>

  <p>Verify that the API User Security Policy is present in the <em>Policies</em> folder of the Policy Manager root  Organization as illustrated below. It should be added automatically as part of the Community Manager feature installation. The name assigned to the default policy is AtmosphereUserSecurityPolicy.</p>

  <p>If the policy does not display, verify that you have correctly installed the Community Manager features. If  you need an additional instance of the API User Security Policy to customize, use <strong>Add Policy</strong> to create one.</p>

  <p>This policy type creates a policy with a default configuration that looks like the following:</p>

  <h5>Step 2: View Policy References and  Attachments</h5>
<p>You can view the services the default API User Security Policy is attached to by selecting <strong>View Policy References</strong> from the Actions Portlet on the <em>Policy Details </em>page. </p>
<p><img src="images/view_policy_ref_api_user_sec_policy.jpg" width="583" height="442"></p>
<p>You can also view a policy attached to a service on the Policy Attachments Portlet in <em>SOA Software Community Manager</em>  &gt; <em>Services</em>  &gt; <em>Service Details</em>).</p>
