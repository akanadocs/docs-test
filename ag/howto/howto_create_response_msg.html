<h2 id="top">How to Create a Response Message</h2>
<p>This article describes how to create a virtual service process that creates a response message using input from the request message and returns this response to the consumer. This is useful for creating sandbox services. In this case I am adding a protocol header that is specific to SOAP, this header would only be returned via a SOAP binding, but the process generates a normalized XML message that can be returned via any of the bindings, including being mediated to JSON if that is required.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this article doesn't cover configuring the bindings, all it does is tell you how to create the response message and wire that into your process.</p>



<h3>Step 1 - Define a Variable</h3>
<p>Use the <strong>A</strong> button on the Process Editor palette to define a new variable name of type message. To match the script below, we'll call this new message variable <strong>newMsg</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: all adding a variable here does is to make the variable name available to other activities in the Process Editor.</p>



<h3>Step 2 - Set the Reply to use the new Variable</h3>
<p>Edit the reply activity and pick your new message variable as the response message (the field labelled variable).</p>



<h3>Step 3 - Add a Script Activity between the receive and the reply</h3>
<p>Add a script activity between the receive and the reply, and use the script below. This script performs a few operations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Creates a new normalized message.</li>
	<li>Normalizes the input request and converts the resulting normalized message to a JavaScript object.</li>
	<li>Sets the content of the new normalized message as a string built using an element taken from the JavaScript object (in this case we know that the input request contains an element called <strong>cin</strong>).</li>
	<li>Adds a new protocol (binding) header to the new message&#8212;this is optional, and is here simply to show how this works between SOAP and REST bindings (it's ignored by the REST binding).</li>
</ul>
<pre>// Create a new normalized message and add it as a variable to the process context
var newMsg = msgFactory.createNormalized();
processContext.setVariable("newMsg",newMsg);

// Get the input message and normalize it
var nm = processContext.getVariable("message").normalize();

// Convert the normalized input message to JSON and parse it to a JavaScript Object
converter = com.soa.json.xml.script.XML2JSON.converter();
var jsonString = converter.convert(nm.getContentAsString());
var jsObj = JSON.parse(jsonString,null);

// Set the content of our new normalized message to the body content of the soap response
// NOTE: this is the bit that will be inside the &lt;soap:body&gt; tag, it does not include that tag
newMsg.setStringContent("&lt;brwr:cin xmlns:brwr=\"http://soap.borrower.demo.soa.com\"&gt;" + jsObj.cin + "&lt;/brwr:cin&gt;")

// Add a protocol header to the new normalized message. The outbound binding will add this to the SOAP envelope when it sends it
newMsg.setProtocolHeader("{http://demo.akana.com/}DemoHead", "&lt;demo:Demohead xmlns:demo=\"http://demo.akana.com/DemoHeade_V_1_0\"/&gt;");
</pre>



<h3>Step 4 - Preserve Binding Headers - Optional</h3>
<p>Edit the operation, select <strong>Header Propagation</strong>, and set <strong>Preserved Binding Headers</strong> to <strong>all</strong>, or add the specific header you want to pass through the downstream binding in this list.</p>
<p>This is only needed if you want to pass specific headers back to the consumer. For REST consumers you would typically enable <strong>Preserve Transport Headers</strong> and would use the <span class="apidoc_code">setTransportHeaders()</span> function, as shown below.</p>
<pre>headers = processContext.getVariable("newMsg").getTransportHeaders();
headers.add("HeaderName", "headerValue");</pre>
