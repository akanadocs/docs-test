<h1 id="top">How to Invoke a Service from Script</h1>
<p>This is an example of a script showing how to invoke a service using the Messenger Service. See the full docs for the Messenger Service in the script documentation. From <a href="../generated_docs/apidoc_scripting_api_all.htm">Scripting API Documentation for the Akana API Platform and Policy Manager</a>, choose the correct version.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: you can set outbound identities using the Manage Outbound Activies action on the virtual service. Alternatively you can set principals within the script, but this is more complex.</p>
<pre>// Grab the message variable for input
var msg = processContext.getVariable("message");

// Set up the new messenger service and instance instances
messenger = msgrService.getMessenger();
exchangeFactory = msgrService.createExchangeFactory();
exchange = exchangeFactory.createInOut();

// Tell the messenger service exchange which service, interface, and operation to invoke
exchange.setServiceName("{http://soap.borrower.demo.soa.com}BorrowerSOAP");
exchange.setInterfaceName("{http://soap.borrower.demo.soa.com}BorrowerService");
exchange.setOperationName("list");

// Tell the messenger service exchange which message variable to use as it's input
exchange.setInMessage(msg);

// Send the message
messenger.send(exchange);

// Read the response and override the input msg variable with the response
msg = exchange.getOutMessage();

// Replace the message variable in the process with the result of the invoke
processContext.setVariable("message",msg);
</pre>
<p>That's it. Nice and simple.</p>
