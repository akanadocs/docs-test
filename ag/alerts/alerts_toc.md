### About Alerts

* The *Alerts* section of the Management Console provides an event monitoring system that is used to monitor web services and associated system activity that occurs during the operation of your Policy Manager deployment. 
* You can configure which alert types you would like to monitor and define the notification parameters that will be invoked when a transaction, operation, or event fails. 
* The specific types of events or failures that raise alerts are predefined as *Alert Codes*.
* Alert functionality includes configuration and management tools for viewing, analyzing, and filtering alert data. 
* The Alerts tab on the main navigation is the starting point for beginning alert administration activities.
