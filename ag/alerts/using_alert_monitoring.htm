<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3>About Alert Monitoring</h3>
<p>Alerts are raised when a system condition matches an active Alert Code. Each alert is associated with functionality that occurs in Policy Manager subsystems. Alerts also include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A Severity identifier</li>
	<li>The Alert Code representing the Policy Manager functional area</li>
	<li>The Container that is managing the web service operations</li>
</ul>

<p>Use this information to review the alert condition and determine the appropriate method of response (an alert response is configured using state filters).</p>
<p>Alert data can also be exported to an XML file to facilitate additional analysis or reporting requirements.</p>

<h3>About Alert States</h3>
<p>When a new alert is raised, the state filter is set to <strong>Unobserved</strong>. During the decision-support process, an alert state is typically changed to <strong>Observed</strong> while the problem is being investigated. When an alert resolution is found, comments are then added to the alert record and the state filter is changed to <strong>Resolved</strong>.</p>
<p>Location: In the Policy Manager Management Console, go to <strong>Alerts</strong> &gt; <strong>Alert Monitoring</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="filter_alerts">Filter Alerts</h2>
<p>Use search criteria to filter what Alerts are displayed. Refer to <a href="#alert_monitoring_search_criteria">Alert Monitoring Search Criteria</a> for a description of each filter option.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Alerts</strong> &gt; <strong>Alert Monitoring</strong>.</li>
	<li>Configure the following search criteria:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>ID Filter</strong>: Enter the Alert ID, or Alert Code ID to view alerts generated from a single alert code.</li>
			<li><strong>Time-Range Filter</strong>: Specify a time period to view alerts logged within a specific time frame.</li>
			<li><strong>Severity Filter</strong>: To see only alerts of a given severity level select one or more check-boxes.</li>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="observe_alerts">Observe Alerts</h2>
<p>When an alert is generated, it is considered to be unseen or <strong>unobserved</strong>, implying that no one is aware that the alert has been logged, and consequently no one is taking steps to correct whatever problem the alert reports.</p>

<p>When you mark an alert as <strong>observed</strong>, you indicate that the alert has been seen and that steps are being taken to analyze and resolve the issue. The <strong>Observed</strong> state can be configured via the <strong>Alerts</strong> screen or the <strong>View Alert</strong> screen.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Alerts</strong> &gt; <strong>Alert Monitoring</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select the alert you would like to view, and click <strong>View Alert</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Observe</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are returned to the <strong>Alert Monitoring Summary</strong> screen. The <strong>Obs</strong> column displays with a check mark and is grayed out, indicating that the state of the alert has been changed to <strong>Observed</strong>.</p>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: To change the observe status from the <strong>Alerts</strong> screen, click the check-box in the <strong>Obs</strong> column, and click <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
<ol>
	<li>To view the change to the Observe status in the alert record, on the <strong>Alerts</strong> screen, select the alert record and click <strong>View Alert</strong>.
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Alert State</strong> is changed to <strong>Observed</strong>.</li>
		<li><strong>Observed By</strong> contains the name of the user who updated the status.</li>
		<li><strong>Observed On</strong> displays the date/time stamp that the observed status was updated.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>Review the <strong>Observed (not Resolved)</strong> column of the <strong>Alert Monitoring Summary</strong> screen to view the number of alert records that are configured with an <strong>Observed</strong> state.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="resolve_alerts">Resolve Alerts</h2>
<p>When an alert is generated, by default it is unresolved, meaning that whatever condition caused the alert to be generated has not yet been addressed or fully corrected.</p>S

<p>Whether you ignore an alert or, due to its importance, immediately address it, eventually no further action will be required. At this point, you mark an alert as resolved, indicating that the alert is no longer an open or outstanding issue.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Alerts</strong> &gt; <strong>Alert Monitoring</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select the alert you would like to view, and click <strong>View Alert</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Resolve</strong>. You are returned to the <strong>Alert Summary</strong> screen. The Alert you have resolved is grayed out and a check appears in the <strong>Res</strong> column.
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To change the resolve status from the Alerts screen, click the <strong>check-box</strong> in the <strong>Res</strong> column, and click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
		<li>If Resolution proves premature, you can reopen or <strong>unresolve</strong> the alert.</li>
		<li>A <strong>Resolved</strong> Alert is marked as <strong>observed</strong> and remains so even if it is later <strong>unresolved</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>To view the change to the Resolved status in the alert record, on the Alerts screen, select the alert record and click <strong>View Alert</strong>.
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Alert State</strong> is changed to <strong>Resolved</strong>.</li>
		<li><strong>Resolved By</strong> contains the name of the user who updated the status.</li>
		<li><strong>Resolved On</strong> displays the date/time stamp that the resolved status was updated.</li>
</ul></li>
		<li>Review the <strong>Resolved</strong> column of the <strong>Alert Monitoring Summary</strong> screen to view the number of alert records that are configured with a <strong>Resolved</strong> state.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="view_alert_codes">View Alert Codes for Alerts</h2>
<p>When addressing an alert, particularly if it is of a type that seldom occurs, it is useful to look at the details of the alert code upon which the alert is based.</p>
