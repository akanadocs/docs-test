<h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p>The Business Metrics Policy specifies what business  specific metrics should be gathered from the contents of the messages being  exchanged. It differs from an Operational Metrics Policy in that the  information collected is not general to all messages but very specific using  data from message payloads, headers, or URL&rsquo;s.  </p>
