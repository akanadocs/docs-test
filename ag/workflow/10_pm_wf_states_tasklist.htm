<p>Description of special workflow state and workflow task list.</p>
<hr class="divide_hr" />



<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Workflow states can be classified into two categories:</p>
<ul>
	<li>	A state that requires immediate attention</li>
	<li>A  state that does not</li>
</ul>
<p>To mark a workflow state as requiring immediate attention, you can prepend or append one or more exclamation point symbols (!) to the name of the Workflow state. For example, <strong>Pending Approve!!!</strong> or <strong>!Pending Approve</strong>.</p>
<p>When a workflow enters a state with this special markup, it is added into the Workflow task list so user can be immediately notified via Workbench's Workflow task portlet.</p>
