<a href="http://docs.soa.com/docs-test/ag/admin_console/using_network_director_feature.htm"><h3>SOA Software Network Director</h3></a>






<p>This feature enables a Container to host Virtual Services. The Virtual Services  are defined in the SOA Software Management Console. When the Network Director  feature is enabled, the Container's metadata is updated to reflect this support.  The metadata must be updated in the SOA Software Management Console so that it  is aware that Virtual Services can be hosted on the Container. The feature also  enables support for default Bindings and Policies. The default Bindings are SOAP  and HTTP (REST and POX). The default Policies are WS-Addressing, WS-Auditing,  WS-Security, HTTP Security, Authentication, and Authorization.</p>
