<h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p>SOA Software Platform administration is performed using the <em>SOA Software Administration Console</em>. After the <em>SOA Software Platform Installation Wizard</em> installs the SOA Software Platform application, and the <em>Configure Container Instance Wizard</em> is used to define a container that will host selected features,  the <em>SOA Software Administration Console</em> is used to perform feature installation, configuration, and maintenance tasks.   </p>



<a name="available">
<h3>Available Features</h3></a>


<p>The <em>Available Features</em> tab displays a list of features, tools, and plug-ins that are available to be installed on the current SOA Software Container instance. </p>
<h4>Feature List</h4>

A default repository (SOA Software Platform Default Repository) is added as part of the initial SOA Software Platform installation. </p>
<h4>Install Container Updates</h4>
<p>SOA Software Container Updates are distributed using a Repository URL that points to a repository that contains designated product features or updates. The Repository URL is added to the <em>Repository</em> tab via the SOA Software Administration Console. Updates include bundles that represent new features, or updates to existing features. </p>
<p>  After a Repository URL is added to the &quot;Repository,&quot; updates to a specific feature can be applied by clicking the <strong>Search for Updates</strong> button via the <em>Installed Features</em> tab and applying the list of updates found.  </p>
<p>  This section provides instructions for adding a Repository URL to the SOA Software Administration Console and applying an update.</p>

<h3>System</h3></a>
<p>The <em>System</em> tab provides a summary of the SOA Software Platform process characteristics and states. Information includes the last start time of the process, memory details (i.e., Total, Used, Free), and a listing of associated system properties. System details can be used to review system health and for troubleshooting purposes. </p>
<h4>Restart Container</h4>
<p>To restart the current SOA Software Container instance and associated bundles, click <strong>Restart</strong>. Note that <strong>Restart</strong> applies to standalone deployments only.</p>
<h4>Generate System Report</h4>
