<h3>Add Activity</h3>
</a>

<p>Each &quot;Orchestration Policy&quot; includes an <strong>Add Activity</strong> function allows you add one or more activities to the current policy definition. See <a href="orch_policy_activities.htm">Orchestration Policy Activities</a> for a list of supported activities.</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>In the &quot;Add Activity&quot; section, you can add one or more activities to the &quot;Orchestration Policy&quot; by selecting an activity name from the drop-down list box and clicking <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
  <li>Each &quot;Orchestration Policy&quot; must include one &quot;Invoke Service&quot; activity that is enabled as a Backend Service.</li>
  <li>When you initially create an &quot;Orchestration Policy&quot; an &quot;Invoke Service&quot; activity is added to the policy by default with the &quot;Designate as Backend Service&quot; enabled.</li>
  <li>If you attempt to save an &quot;Orchestration Policy&quot; and it does not include an &quot;Invoke Service&quot; activity with the &quot;Designate as Backend Service&quot; enabled, the system will raise an error and will not allow you to save the policy until the backend service requirement is met. </li>
  <li>You can add any number of activities based on your requirements.</li>
  <li>You must configure a &quot;Reply&quot; for each activity. See <a href="#configure_reply">Configure Reply</a>.</li>
  <li>You can sequence activities using the Move Up and Move Down buttons. See <a href="#sequence_orch">Sequence Orchestration Policy Activities</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To add an activity:</strong></p>
<ol class="usingunOrderedList">
  <li>On the &quot;Orchestration Policy Details,&quot; click <strong>Modify</strong>. The &quot;Modify Orchestration Policy&quot; screen displays and includes a default &quot;Invoke Service&quot; activity.</li>
  <li>Configure the default &quot;Invoke Service&quot; policy to meet your requirements. See <a href="invoke_service_activity.htm">Invoke Service Activity</a> for a functional overview.<br>

  <li>To add additional policies, in the &quot;Add Activity&quot; section, select an activity name from the drop-down list box. See &nbsp;<a href="orch_policy_activities.htm">Orchestration Policy Activities</a> for a list of supported activities.<br>

<a name="configure_reply">
<h3>Configure Reply</h3>
</a>

<p>Each &quot;Orchestration Policy&quot; includes a &quot;Reply&quot; that is located at the bottom of the policy. A &quot;Reply&quot; represents the message you want to send back to the user (i.e., client) of the virtual service.</p>
<p>  You can reply with the default message (i.e., Message) or specify a User-Defined message.</p>
<p><em>Note: The Reply applies to the entire policy configuration.</em></p>

<a name="sequence_orch">
<h3>Sequence Orchestration Policy Activities</h3>
</a>

<p>Each Activity in an &quot;Orchestration Policy&quot; includes a button bar that includes <strong>Move Up</strong> and <strong>Move Down</strong> buttons. After you have defined activities for your Orchestration Policy, you can sequence the order of execution using these buttons. When a sequencing option is not available, it will display grayed out.</p>

<a name="attach_orch">
<h3>Attach Orchestration Policy to Service Operation</h3>
</a>


<p>Because each Orchestration Policy defines the workflow for a specific service operation, it must also be attached to that service operation.</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>The policy must be attached via the &quot;Policy Attachments Portlet&quot; at the <em>Organization &gt; Services &gt; Operations</em> level.</li>
  <li>The policy should be attached in the &quot;Operation&quot; section of the Operational Policy Attachments Portlet, and <em>not</em> the &quot;Input Message&quot; or &quot;Output Message&quot; sections.</li>
  <li>See Manage Operational Policy Attachments (Operations) for more information.</li>
</ul>
