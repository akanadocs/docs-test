<h3>Introduction</h3></a>
<p>By default, all DataPower transactions for all managed services must pass  contract authorization in order to DataPower to pass the transaction. If  contract authorization fails, DataPower will always fail the transaction.</p>
<p>If contracts are not needed for a given managed DataPower service or  service operation, they can be disabled via Policy Manager using the DataPower Contracts Policy. </p>
<p><em>Note that  disabling contracts is a potential security hole, as DataPower will let a  transaction succeed even if that transaction would normally fail due to a  contract authorization failure.</em></p>
