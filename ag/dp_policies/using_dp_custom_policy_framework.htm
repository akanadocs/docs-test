<h3>Introduction</h3></a>
<p>The <em>SOA Software Policy Manager Custom Policy Framework</em> feature, provides functionality for adding custom policies to Policy Manager. These policies can then be attached to a service in order to change the behavior of that service at runtime. </p>
The Custom Policy Framework includes a series of sample XML policies that illustrate levels of functionality you can add to a policy definition. Review the sample policies to become familiar with how they are structured and options available to you. You can then deploy the samples and view the user-interface of each policy in the <em>Policy Manager Management Console</em> to determine what options you would like to use in your own custom policies.</p>
