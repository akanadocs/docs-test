<h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p>The "User-Defined DataPower Policy Component" is a Policy  Manager pipeline component that references a policy defined in IBM WebSphere  DataPower in the form of reusable user-defined processing rules located on the  WebSphere DataPower Appliance. A processing rule must first be defined on the  WebSphere DataPower Appliance before it can be used with this component. The  "Rule Name" assigned to the processing rule in the WebSphere DataPower Appliance  must match the name specified in the "DataPower Processing Rule Name" field of  this component. DataPower rule content can also be uploaded directly to the component. </p>
<p>This component is used if you have performed a DataPower  Integration by installing the "SOA Software Platform" and installing and  configuring the "SOA Software Policy Manager for IBM WebSphere DataPower"  feature.
  </p>
<a name="using_contexts">
<h3>Using Contexts with User-Defined DataPower Policy</h3></a>
<p>When enforcing the User-Defined DataPower Policy Component,  DataPower will call out to a user defined processing rule previously defined as  a "Processing Rule" object in the DataPower domain being governed. This rule  will perform an important user-defined function such as security processing or  transformation.</p>
<p>When authoring this rule, the proper use of DataPower  contexts is critical to the functioning of the rule and the larger service.</p>
<p>The following lists the key points that should be followed  for the proper use of contexts.</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>
  If actions in the user defined  processing rule need to read the current request or response message, their  input context should be set to &lsquo;INPUT&rsquo;</li>
  <li>The &lsquo;INPUT&rsquo; context within the  user defined processing rule contains the request or response message as it has  been modified over the course of DataPower processing up to the invocation of  the user defined rule. It does not contain the original message as received by  DataPower.</li>
  <li>If actions in the user defined  processing rule need to modify the current request or response message, their  input context should be set to &lsquo;OUTPUT&rsquo;. The context written to this output will  be represented in the response message to DataPower&rsquo;s consumer.</li>
  <li>The &lsquo;OUTPUT&rsquo; context within  the user defined processing rule will be used as the OUTPUT context of the  larger transaction once the user defined processing policy completes. That  content will be available to other downstream user defined processing rules via  the &lsquo;INPUT&rsquo; context for that rule as per normal functionality.</li>
  <li>If a user defined processing  rule action does not need access to the &lsquo;INPUT&rsquo; context for the action&rsquo;s input  or &lsquo;OUTPUT&rsquo; context for the action&rsquo;s output, it should use the &lsquo;NULL&rsquo; context  instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using User Defined Authentication Policy with Contract Authorization</h3></a>
<p>The &quot;User-Defined DataPower Policy Component&quot; can be used to include an AAA authentication policy in your Policy Manager for DataPower deployed services. If you want the authenticated identity resulting from this policy to be the identity used when DataPower performs contract authorization, you must make DataPower aware of this identity.</p>
<p>
  This can be done by setting two DataPower variables as part of the post processing of your AAA authentication policy. These variables should be set as follows:</p>

<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>var://context/soa/authenticatedidentities/consumer/identity/username –a string value containing the username of the authenticated identity. For example 'johndoe'.</li>
  <li>var://context/soa/authenticatedidentities/consumer/identity/domain –a string value containing the Policy Manager domain that the username is a part of. For example 'Local Domain'.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following code sets the identity information:</p>
<p>dp:set-variable name=&quot;'var://context/soa/authenticatedidentities/consumer/identity/username'&quot; value=&quot;'johndoe'&quot; /&gt;</p>
  <p>dp:set-variable name=&quot;'var://context/soa/authenticatedidentities/consumer/identity/domain'&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;value=&quot;'Local Domain'&quot; /&gt;</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3></a>



<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the  User-Defined DataPower Policy Component configuration process to get your started.</p>
<p><em>Note: A  User-Defined DataPower Policy (non-pipeline) version must be  added using the Add Policy Wizard and defined and configured prior to this  configuration as the User-Defined Category from this policy is referenced in the  pipeline version of the policy.</em></p>
<h5>Step 1: Add Policy</h5>
<p>You can create a Pipeline Policy instance using <strong>Add Policy</strong> in the <em>Policies &gt; Operational Policies</em> section.</p>
<h5>Step 2: Modify Policy</h5>
<p>When you <strong>Modify</strong> the Pipeline Policy, and use <strong>Add Component</strong> to add the  User-Defined DataPower Policy Component, the<strong> Modify Pipeline Policy</strong> will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/modify_pipeline_userdefined_dp_policy.jpg" width="566" height="393"></p>
<p>This policy  is used  in the Request Configuration, Response Configuration, and Fault Configuration and can be positioned anywhere in the request, response, or fault. </p>
<h5>Step 3: Configure  </h5>


<p>The process of configuring the User-Defined DataPower  Policy Component involves adding a processing rule that is defined in the WebSphere DataPower appliance. </p>
<p>To configure the User-Defined DataPower Policy Component , select the policy and click <strong>Modify Component</strong> and configure the following options on the <em>Modify User-Defined DataPower Policy Component</em> screen. </p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li> <strong>DataPower Processing Rule Name</strong> - Add a &quot;Rule Name&quot;assigned to the processing  rule in the WebSphere DataPower Appliance. Note that &quot;Rule  Name&quot; specified in the "DataPower Processing Rule Name" field must match the  "Rule Name" assigned to the WebSphere DataPower Appliance. </li>
  <li><strong>Authenticate Consumer Identity</strong> - Select if you would like the rule to perform authentication of the consumer identity. </li>
  <li><strong>Use Uploaded DataPower Configuration</strong> - If you would like to store the rule configuration in Policy Manager, select this option and upload the rule content. Note that the DataPower Processing Rule Name must still be specified in the &quot;DataPower Processing Rule Name&quot; field when using this option. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Step 4: Attach Policy</h5>
<p>After you have saved your policy you can  attach it to a web service  or you can attach the policy at the Organization level and the policy will be active for all services defined within the organization. </p>
