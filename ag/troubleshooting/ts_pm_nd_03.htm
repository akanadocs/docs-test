<h2 id="s03_01">Connection Errors Returned for Configured Context Paths</h2>
<p>A number of different issues might cause a connection error to be returned from the Network Director. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There might be a 404 error on loading the WSDL for a SOAP service. If you use the browser to access the WSDL using <strong>{endpoint}?wsdl</strong>, and get a 404 error rather than the WSDL file, the first step in troubleshooting is to check that the virtual service is providing a WSDL. For instructions, see <a href="#proc_chk_nd_ret_wsdl">To check that the Network Director can retrieve the virtual service WSDL</a> later in this section.</li>
	<li>For a SOAP or REST service, you might send a request to the virtual service and receive a 404 in response.</li>
	</ul>
<p>If you are getting a 404 when invoking a virtual service, here are some things you can check:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Check to see if the service is being hosted. To do this, enable the jetty URL to verify that all services/context paths are available. For instructions, see Check Context Paths Hosted on Network Director below).</li>
	<li>Make sure that the context path being sent by the consumer matches the context path for the virtual service being invoked.</li>
	<li>For a REST service:
		<ul>
			<li>Verify that the context path being sent by the consumer matches the virtual service context path.</li>
			<li>Make sure the correct content type is being set in the HTTP header.</li>
			<li>If there is a payload, make sure the payload is consistent with the content-type.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Check the usage logs to see if the physical service is responding with the 404. If it is the physical service responding with a 404, verify the physical service access point.</li>
	<li>Check if there is an issue with the firewall or load balancer that the consumer is sending the request through.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="s03_01_01">Check Context Paths Hosted on Network Director</h3>
<p>If a 404 is returned to the consumer when trying to invoke a virtual service, check the context paths hosted on the Network Director.</p>

<h4>Solution:</h4>
<p>Possible reasons for this issue are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The service is not deployed on the Network Director. See <a href="#proc_check_svc_deployed">To check whether the service is deployed to the Network Director</a> below.</li>
	<li>A 404 was returned from the physical service (physical service is down). See <a href="#s03_01_02">Virtual Service Cannot Connect to Physical Services</a> below.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="proc_check_svc_deployed">To check whether the service is deployed to the Network Director</h4>
<p>Check the contexts hosted on the Network Director.</p>
<p>There is a URL you can use to list all the context paths hosted on the Network Director. To view the context paths, you must first enable a configuration setting as described below.</p>

<h4 id="proc_context_paths_check">To check context paths from the Network Director</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Akana Administration Console for the Network Director instance at http://{nd_host}:{nd_port}/admin/console.html.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Configuration Categories</strong> section on the left, choose <strong>com.soa.transport.jetty.defaultservlet</strong>.</li>
	<li>Set the value of the jetty.information.servlet.listContexts property to <strong>true</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</li>
	<li>Check the URL to get the list of context paths on the Network Director and see if your service is listed:
	<pre>http://{nd_host}:{nd_port}/com.soa.transport.jetty/information</pre></li>
</ol>


<h3 id="s03_01_02">Virtual Service Cannot Connect to Physical Service</h3>
<p>If the virtual service cannot connect to the next-hop service or physical service, two possible causes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The physical service is down.</li>
	<li>The wrong access point has been configured for the physical service.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solution:</h4>
<p>To help determine where the issue lies, first send a request to the endpoint you listed under the physical service access point. Verify that the response was received. Depending on the results:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the physical service is down, contact the physical service provider.</li>
	<li>If the direct request was successful, and there is a firewall between the virtual service and the physical service, check in case there's an issue with either of the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Firewall</li>
			<li>Proxy server</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>

<h2 id="s03_02">Unable to Access Policy Manager Container</h2>
<p>In some cases it has happened that consumers were unable to connect to the Policy Manager services, with no error when loading bundles, and with the log showing the following entry:</p>
<pre>ERROR - Attempting to invoke method refresh on 
com.soa.container.configuration.service.ContainerConfigPollingService.</pre>
<p>One possible cause of this issue is that the maximum number of threads for the HTTP listener is set to 0 and must be increased.</p>
<h4>Solution:</h4>
<p>As a workaround, you can edit the <strong>system.properties</strong> file to create a temporary HTTPS listener entry. This will allow you to log in and increase the number of threads on the HTTP listener. You must then restore the original <strong>system.properties</strong> file.</p>

<h4 id="proc_http_listener_increase_max_threads">To increase the maximum number of threads for the HTTP listener</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the ./sm60/instances/{pm_instance} folder on your machine and find the <strong>system.properties</strong> file. Save a backup copy of the original file.</li>
	<li>In the file, find the <strong>org.osgi.service.http.port</strong> property and set it to <strong>9900</strong> (or your original port).</li>
	<li>Modify the property name and value as shown below:
		<p><strong>org.osgi.service.http.port.secure</strong>: set it to <strong>9943</strong> (or some other port)</p>
		<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: This change creates a temporary HTTPS listener so that you can log in and update the thread count for the HTTP listener.</p></li>
	<li>Restart the container.</li>
	<li>Go to https://host:9943/ (or applicable port number) and log in to the Policy Manager console.</li>
	<li>Change the default listener pool parameters to valid values. For example:
		<ul>
			<li>min thread=<strong>5</strong></li>
			<li>max thread=<strong>200</strong></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	
	<li>Restore the original <strong>system.properties</strong> file.</li>
	<li>Restart the container.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="s03_03">Virtual Service Client Cannot Connect to Physical Service</h2>
<p>If the client application cannot connect to the physical service, check the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If it isn't a SOAP service, go to <a href="#s03_02_01">Hosted Service Issues</a> below to check if the service is running.</li>
	<li>If it is a SOAP service, check that the virtual service is providing a WSDL. See <a href="#proc_chk_nd_ret_wsdl">To check that the Network Director can retrieve the virtual service WSDL</a> below.</li>
	<li>Depending on the results, do one of the following: 
		<ul>
			<li>If there is an error retrieving the WSDL, there is an issue with hosting the virtual service. Go to the <a href="#s03_02_01">Hosted Service Issues</a> section below.</li>
			<li>If there was no error with the WSDL, the issue is at the policy/contract level. For additional troubleshooting steps, go to <a href="#proc_chk_policy_config">To check policy configuration</a> below. If it is an issue with the policy or contract there should be an error in the alerts or the monitoring data for the service.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="proc_chk_nd_ret_wsdl">To check that the Network Director can retrieve the virtual service WSDL</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Open a browser.</li>
	<li>Enter the URL of the virtual service:
		<pre>{nd_host}:{nd_port}/{service_context_path}</pre></li>
	<li>Append <strong>?wsdl</strong> to the end of the URL.
		<p>The WSDL file for the virtual service should be displayed in the browser. Proceed depending on what you see:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the WSDL file is not displayed, there is an issue with the hosted service. For additional troubleshooting steps, go to the next section, <a href="#s03_02_01">Hosted Service Issues</a>, below.</li>
			<li>If the WDSL file is displayed, this means that the service is hosted correctly; therefore, the physical service address must be wrong, or there must be an issue with the physical service. Check the access point in the Policy Manager user interface to make sure it is correct. One possible scenario is that the physical endpoint changed after setup. You can make sure you can successfully call the physical service in the same way you did for the virtual service in Step 2, using the URL of the physical service as set up in Policy Manager container.</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ol>


<h3 id="s03_02_01">Hosted Service Issues</h3>
<p>If you cannot connect to the service, and you were not able to retrieve the WSDL file, follow the steps below.</p>

<h4 id="proc_hosting_vs_resolve">To resolve issues with hosting the virtual service</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Verify the access point being used. To do this:
		<ul>
			<li>In Policy Manager, from the organization tree, select the virtual service.</li>
			<li>In the right pane, click the <strong>Access Points</strong> tab.</li>
			<li>Verify that the access point is still listed for that service. If it isn't listed, go to the Network Director container, <strong>Hosted Services</strong> tab, and click <strong>Host Virtual Service</strong>. Select the virtual service to host on the Network Director container or cluster.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	
	<li>Next, verify the status of the container. To do this:
		<ul>
			<li>In Policy Manager, from the organization tree, select the container that hosts the virtual service.</li>
			<li>In the right pane, click the Details tab.</li>
			<li>Check the status of the container. The status should display as <strong>Started</strong>, with a green icon.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	
	<li>Take additional steps depending on the container status and settings:
		<ul>
			<li>If the container has not started, check that the bundles have loaded.</li>
		<li>Stopped or Unresponsive: In Network Director, go to the Network Director Container Detail Page for the container and view the status indicator for the container. There are three statuses: <strong>Started</strong>, <strong>Stopped</strong>, and <strong>Unresponsive</strong>. The status is communicated from Network Director to Policy Manager every 15 seconds using the Policy Manager service called <strong>Container State Service</strong>. If Policy Manager doesn't receive a response from Network Director in a certain amount of time, the status is reported as <strong>Unresponsive</strong>. If there is no response for an extended period of time the status is reported as <strong>Stopped</strong>. This indicates a communication problem between Policy Manager and Network Director.</li>
		<li>Check the Network Director log file and see if there are any issues connecting to Policy Manager.</li>
		<li>Check the Policy Manager log to see if there are any errors when the Network Director is connecting to Policy Manager to update its state.</li>
		<li>HTTPS address listed as service access point: Verify that the HTTPS listener has PKI keys and an X.509 certificate attached.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="proc_chk_policy_config">To check policy configuration</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Policy Manager console.</li>
	<li>Select the virtual service and then check for errors under <strong>Workbench</strong> > <strong>Monitoring</strong> > <strong>Alerts</strong>.
<p><img src="assets/03_01.jpg" alt="Checking policy configuration" /></p></li>
	<li>Make sure:
		<ul>
			<li>The consumer is included in the contract of the service.</li>
			<li>The contract is activated.</li>
			<li>There is only one contract active for the service.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="s03_02_02">Contract Not Configured</h3>
<p>If an <strong>Authorization Failed</strong> message is returned when consuming a service, one possible cause is that the contract is not configured.</p>

<h4>Solution:</h4>
<p>To check whether the contract is configured correctly, and correct as needed, follow the steps below.</p>

<h4 id="proc_contract_configure">To configure a contract</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Policy Manager console.</li>
	<li>From the organization tree, select the virtual service.</li>
	<li>Verify that the intended consumer is listed under the consumers portlet for the virtual service.
	<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the intended consumer is not listed, you'll need to create another version of the contract. On the action panel to the right, click Start New Version. Under consumer identities, add the new consumer and then activate the new version of the contract. This will create a new version that includes the appropriate consumer.</p></li>
	<li>Verify that the approval status of the provided contract is Activated.</li>
	<li>If the contract is listed as Deactivated, activate it:
		<ol>
			<li>From the Consumers portlet, select the contract.</li>
			<li>From the actions portlet, select <strong>Activate Contract</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wait for approximately one minute for the contract to go into effect.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	</ol>

<h2 id="s03_04">Cannot Connect to Physical Service that Requires WS-Security Headers</h2>
<p>If requests to a physical service that requires WS-Security headers fail, it might be because the WS- Security headers are being stripped out.</p>
<p>By default, the Network Director strips out the WS-Security headers before sending the request to the physical endpoint.</p>

<h4>Solution:</h4>
<p>If the WS-Security headers are required by the physical endpoint, you can set a property in the Akana Administration Console for the Network Director instance so that the headers are not stripped out.</p>

<h4 id="proc_wssecurity_headers_modify">To modify configuration to keep the WS-Security headers</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Akana Administration Console for the Network Director instance (http://
		{nd_host}:{nd_port}/admin).</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Categories</strong> portlet, select the <strong>com.soa.wssecurity</strong> category.</li>
	<li>Set the value of the <strong>keepsecurityHeader</strong> property to <strong>true</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
