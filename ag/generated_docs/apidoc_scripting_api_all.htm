<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using scripting with your Akana Platform or Akana API Platform, it's best to use the Akana Scripting API rather than using third-party scripting APIs such as Jetty. If you are using third-party APIs, even if they work in the version ofo the Akana Platform that you are using, they might not work in a subsequent version, either because the third-party API itself has changed or because the Akana Platform has upgraded to a newer version of the third-party API. For consistency of user experience and continued support, always use the Akana Platform Scripting API.</p>
