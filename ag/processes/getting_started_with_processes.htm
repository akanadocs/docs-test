<p>The Akana API Platform and Akana Policy Manager allow you to define web service orchestration concepts using an XML-based graphical editor called the Process Palette. Here, you can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Define the sequence of messages as they flow through for each virtual service operation.</li>
	<li>Configure a variety of different <strong>Activities</strong> for achieving the results required for each operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the process types and tools available, to get you started.</p>



<h3 id="process_contexts">Process Contexts</h3>
<p>There are several approaches to configuring process definitions:</p>
<ul>
	<li> You can configure a set of common processes for an organization, using the <strong>Add Process</strong> function. Common processes are available for all resources within the organization.</li>
	<li>You can define a process for a specific operation:
		<ul>
			<li> In Policy Manager, choose <strong>Services</strong> &gt; <strong>Operations</strong> &gt; <strong>Process</strong> or <strong>Services</strong> &gt; <strong>Operations</strong> &gt; <strong>Fault</strong>.</li>
			<li>In the developer portal, go to the API Implementation page.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h5>Referencing a Process</h5>

<p>If you define processes at the organization level, you can reference/re-use them at the operation level. This approach is most efficient for processes that might be used multiple times, and can help make your process development cycle more efficient.</p>
<p><img src="images/sample_process_8x.jpg" alt="Create Common Processes in the Processes folder" /></p>
<p>The example below shows referencing a process using a Process Activity in the Process Editor.</p>
<p><img src="images/process_with_referenced_process_activity_8x.jpg" alt="Referencing a process using a Process Activity in the Process Editor" /></p>

<h5>Referencing a Script</h5>
<p>In the same way that you can reuse a process by referencing it, you can also reuse a script.</p>
<p>You can define a series of utility scripts for performing common tasks. To do this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Add a script:
		<ul>
			<li>In Policy Manager: <strong>Scripts</strong> folder</li>
			<li>In the developer portal: <strong>Organization</strong> &gt; <strong>Scripts</strong></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In your virtual service operation process definition:
		<ol>
			<li>Add a <strong>Script Activity</strong>.</li>
			<li>Import a pre-defined script.</li>
			<li>Add a script reference for the function you want to perform.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, you might have a requirement to validate some data as part of your process. In this example, you might create a reusable script that includes a function for validating data (validateData), and call the script TestScript. Then, in your process definition, you can import TestScript and reference the function in the script source.</p>
<p>This example is shown below.</p>

<h3 id="process_function_reference">Process Function Reference</h3>
<p>The <strong>Process Function Reference</strong> includes a tour of the Process Editor and descriptions and usage examples for each Activity type. To ensure a smooth process when building your process definitions, familiarize yourself with the functionality, techniques, and rules for using each Activity. For more information, refer to <a href="process_reference.htm">Process Reference</a>.</p>

<h3 id="policy_manager_scripting_api">Policy Manager Scripting API</h3>
<p>The Policy Manager Scripting API provides a series of interfaces and classes that you can use to build process-related scripts. You can access this API in the following locations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In Policy Manager: Documentation files in the <strong>docs\scriptDocs</strong> folder of the Akana Platform Folder.</li>
	<li>On the Akana Documentation Repository, choose the applicable version: <a href="../apidoc_scripting_api_all.htm">Policy Manager Scripting API</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="process_management_tools">Process Management Tools</h3>
<p>For an overview of all the tools in the Process Palette, and functions that apply to the common process definitions, see <a href="process_management.htm"> Managing Processes</a>.</p>

<h3 id="process_editor_example">Example: Adding a Script Activity to an operation</h3>
<p>The procedure below walks you through adding a Script activity to a specific operation using the Process Editor. When you've added the script, you can run the operation in Test Client and you will see a new header in the Response/Headers tab.</p>
<h5>Example: to add a specific script activity to an operation</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Open the Process Editor for a specific operation.</li>
	<li>Drag and drop the Script Activity icon to the grid.</li>
	<li>Change the arrows so that the order of activity is <strong>Receive</strong> ><strong> Invoke Activity</strong> > <strong>Script Activity</strong> > <strong>Reply</strong>:
<ol>
			<li>Drag the end arrow from Reply Activity to Script Activity. This directs the Script Activity to execute directly after the Invoke Activity.</li>
			<li>Click the center of the Script Activity and drag and drop (draw) a new arrow to the center of the Reply Activity. This directs the Reply Activity to execute after the Script Activity.</li>
			</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Specify values for the Script Activity:
		<ol>
			<li>Double-click any activity to go to the <strong>Activity Edit</strong> page.</li>
			<li>From the Language drop-down list, choose JavaScript.</li>
			<li>In the Script text box, type or paste the following script:
		<pre>var msg = processContext.getVariable("message");
var headers = msg.getTransportHeaders();
headers.add("myHeaderName", "myHeaderValue");
msg.setTransportHeaders(headers);</pre></li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Save</strong> icon (on the palette) to save the data.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Cancel</strong> to exit the Process Editor and return to the Implementation page.</li>
	</ol>
<p>For additional information on using script activity variables, refer to the <a href="../processes/process_reference.htm#scriptactivity" >Process Editor reference documentation for the Script activity</a>.</p>
