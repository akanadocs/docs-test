<p>SOA Software Policy Manager allows you to define web service orchestration concepts using an XML-based graphical editor called the Process Palette. Here you can define  the sequence of messages as they flow through Policy Manager for each virtual service operation and configure a variety of different &quot;Activities&quot; for achieving the results required for each operation. </p>
<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the process types and  tools available to get your started.  </p>
<br>



<a name="process_contexts">
<h3>Process Contexts</h3></a>



  <p>There are several approaches that can be used to configure your process definitions.
  </p>
  <ul class="usingOrderedList">
    <li>You can define a process from scratch for each  virtual service operation in the <em>Services &gt; Operations &gt; Process</em> or <em>Services &gt; Operations &gt; Fault</em> sections or</li>
    <li> You can  configure a set of &quot;common&quot; processes in the <em>Processes</em> folder of an Organization using the <strong>Add Process</strong> function. </li>

  </ul>

  <h5>Referencing a Process</h5>

  <p>Common processes defined in the Processes folder  can be referenced (and reused)  in the virtual service operation process definition by adding a <em>Process Activity</em>. This reusable approach will save time and make your process development cycle more efficient.</p>

  <br>
  <h5>Referencing a Script</h5>
    <p>Similar to the "Common" processes approach described above, you can also use this same approach with scripts. In the Policy Manager <em>Scripts</em> Folder you can define a series of utility scripts for performing commonly used tasks. This is accomplished using the <strong>Add Script </strong>function. Then in your  virtual service operation process definition,  you add a <em>Script Activity</em>, import a pre-defined script, and add a script reference for the function you want to perform. </p>
    <p> For example, you may have a  requirement to validate some data as part of your process and you created a reusable script (e.g.,  TestScript) that includes a function for validating data (validateData). In your process definition,   import &quot;TestScript&quot; and reference the function in the script source as illustrated below.    </p>

<h3>Process Function Reference</h3></a>
<p>The <em>Process Function Reference</em> includes a tour of the Process Editor and descriptions and usage examples of each Activity type.

 Familiarize yourself with the functionality, techniques, and rules for using each Activity to ensure a smooth process when building your  process definitions. See
<a href="http://soacom.github.io/docs-test/ag/processes/process_reference.htm"> Process Reference</a>.</p>

<h3>Policy Manager Scripting API</h3>
</a>

<p>The <em>Policy Manager Scripting API</em> located in the <strong>\sm70\docs\scriptDocs</strong> folder of the Policy Manager 7.0 Release Folder provides a series of interfaces and classes you can use to build process related scripts. </p>
<p>You can access the scripting API for your Policy Manager version here:  <a href="http://docs.soa.com/ag/assets/scriptDocs/index.html" >Policy Manager 7.0 and 7.1</a> and 
<a href="http://docs.soa.com/ag/assets/scriptDocs_pm72/index.html">Policy Manager 7.2</a><br />

<h3>Process Management Tools</h3></a>


  <p>The <em>Managing Processes</em> topic includes an overview of all the tools in the Process Palette, and functions  that apply to to the common process definitions in the <em>Processes</em> folder. See <a href="http://soacom.github.io/docs-test/ag/processes/process_management.htm"> Managing Processes</a>.</p>

<h3>What's Next?</h3></a>

  <p>Now that you've familiarized yourself with the high-level approach of building processes, and know what  reference materials and tools are available, you can now start building your processes. </p>
