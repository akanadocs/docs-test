<p>Used to add a process instance. A default process instance includes a Receive and Reply activity. </p>
<p>Select <strong>Add Process</strong> on the main <em>Process Summary</em> page and assign a name and description. The Add Process Wizard creates a process instance that you can configure using the Process palatte (i.e., Process tab).</p>

 </p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Note that processes referenced in process definitions via the Process Activity, can only be moved within the current Process  Scope (i.e., Organization, Service, Operation).</li>
  <li>If you wish to move a process  to a different "Organization" the references must stay in scope.</li>
  <li>To determine what references a process  might have, select "View Process References" for the current process. </li>
