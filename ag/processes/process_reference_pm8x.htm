<a name="processes"></a><h3>About Processes</h3>
<p>A process is an ordered graph of activities that can be performed by a container that supports the virtualization capability, such as the Network Director. The logic performed in a virtual service operation is defined as a process. When a message is received by the container, once the virtual service operation is identified, its process is executed. As dictated by the activities in the process, down-stream services may be invoked. As a result of process execution, a response to the original message is generated.
</p>
<p>An example of a process is the default process of a virtual service operation. In that process, a message is received using a <a href="#receiveactivity">Receive Activity</a>, an Invoke Activity is executed that calls the virtualized service operation, and a Reply Activity responds with the response from the Invoke Activity.</p>
<p>Processes can get much more complex to perform functions such as transformation and content-based routing. The author of the process can assemble activities to achieve the desired results.</p>
<p>Policy Manager allows the creation of processes within two different contexts:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>As the implementation of a virtual service operation (<em>Services &gt; Operation &gt; Process</em> or <em>Services &gt; Operation &gt; Fault </em>section)</li>
  <li>As a standalone process (Processes Folder) that can be invoked by another process to achieve reusability.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all contexts, a graphical editor is provided to construct the process.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="processeditor"></a><h3>Process Editor</h3>
<p>The <em>Process Editor</em> allows you to create a process in a graphical drag-and-drop environment. The process begins by receiving a message (see the <a href="#receiveactivity">Receive Activity</a>) and the process ends when a message is returned to the caller (see the <a href="#replyactivity">Reply Activity</a>).</p>
<p><img src="images/process_editor_activity_palette_8x.jpg" width="645" height="337" alt="Process Editor Activity Palette" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Process Editor Activity Palette</p>
<h5>Activities</h5>
<p>The activities available to be called from within a process are available on an <em>Activity Palette</em> located on the upper left hand side of the editor graph. An activity icon in the palette can be selected and dragged on to the process editor graph. Activities are called in order and are linked together by directional connectors. To link two activities, select the middle of the activity that will be executed first. A circle with an error appears.</p>
<p><img src="images/starting_a_link_between_activities.jpg" width="402" height="230" alt="Starting a Link Between Activities" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Starting a Link Between Activities</p>
<p>Drag your mouse to the center of the activity to be executed next and release. A directional connector is drawn, linking the two activities.</p>
<p><img src="images/completing_a_link_between_activities.jpg" width="442" height="138" alt="Completing a Link Between Activities" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Completing a Link Between Activities</p>
<h5>Sequence</h5>
<p>A series of activities linked together is called a <em>Sequence</em>. A sequence is terminated by either a <a href="#branchactivity">Branch Activity</a> (see below) or a <a href="#replyactivity">Reply Activity</a> (see below). A set of linked activities from the <a href="#receiveactivity">Receive Activity</a> to a <a href="#replyactivity">Reply Activity</a> may contain several sequences separated by Branch Activities. That entire set of linked activities is called a <em>Flow</em>.</p>
<p>Functions that can be performed on the entire process are available on a toolbar located on the lower left hand side of the editor graph.</p>
<p><img src="images/process_editor_toolbar_8x.jpg" width="639" height="371" alt="Process Editor Toolbar" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Process Editor Toolbar</p>
<p>The toolbar includes functions such as saving the process, editing the variables used in the process (see <a href="#variableeditor">Variable Editor</a>), refreshing the page, or undoing the last action.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="faultsequenceeditor"></a><h3>Fault Sequence Editor</h3>
<p>Next to the Process Editor tab is a tab labeled <em>Fault</em>. On this tab, you define a sequence of activities to execute if a fault is encountered at any point of your main process. In the main process, once a fault is encountered, the process execution immediately stops and the activity sequence in the Fault tab is executed.</p>
<p>The editor supports a flow for each named fault as identified in the Variables and Faults Editor.</p>
<p>A pull-down of fault names as defined in the Variables and Faults Editor is displayed on the Fault tab. When selecting a fault name from the pull-down the fault flow for the named fault is displayed on the graph. By default each fault flow will have a single Reply activity. The default fault flow is displayed in the pull-down with the <strong>Unnamed</strong> label.</p>
<p><img src="images/fault_sequence_editor_v80.jpg" width="630" height="350" alt="Fault Sequence Editor" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Fault Sequence Editor</p>
<p>The <em>Fault Sequence Editor </em>works in exactly the same way as the main Process Editor except that the sequence does not need to begin with a Receive Activity. The Receive from the external client has already been executed in the main process. At this point we are just executing activities within the same process context.</p>
<p>When the fault sequence is executed, the reserved variable name <strong>fault</strong> contains the fault message that triggers the sequence. Activities that reference variables can use this fault variable.</p>
<p>A fault sequence is not required. If there is no fault sequence, the system simply returns the fault back to the client. If a sequence is constructed, at a minimum a Reply Activity must be present at the end. Any of the activities in the activity palette can be used in the fault sequence, including <a href="#branchactivity">Branch </a> activities. However, each branch must end with a Reply Activity.</p>
<p>The Reply Activity can be configured to return a fault message or a regular message as controlled by the Fault field in the Reply Activity Editor (see the <a href="#replyactivity">Reply Activity</a> section below). The reserved fault name <strong>CurrentFault</strong> as seen in the fault name pull-down indicates that the fault name for the content of the fault variable will be used as-is. The name can be changed to any of the operation faults or to a Binding Fault. This allows you to perform fault mediation.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="variableeditor"></a><h3><img src="images/variables_editor_icon.jpg" width="26" height="30" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="icon" /> Variables and Faults Editor</h3>
<p>The <em>Variables and Faults Editor </em>allows you to define variables that can be used in the process and faults that are handled within the process.</p>
<p>Variables can be used in different activities to dictate behavior, such as using a variable to identify the endpoint of a service to invoke. Variables can also be used to store the output from web service invocations or provide input to web service invocations.</p>
<h4>Variables</h4>


<p>A variable is identified by a name and defined by a type, or syntax. The types recognized by the system are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>message (used for input or output of a web service invocation, request, or Reply Activity)</li>
  <li>string</li>
  <li>int</li>
  <li>long</li>
  <li>boolean</li>
  <li>float</li>
  <li>any (can hold any content)</li>
</ul>
<p>Activities that support the use of variables in their configurations will often restrict the use of variables based on type. Optionally, a default value can be given to a variable. If there is a default, the variable is assigned that value at the beginning of process execution.</p>
<h4>Faults</h4>
<p>Faults can be thrown as a result of an activity. If unhandled the default fault flow is invoked. Optionally, fault flows can be defined for each named fault thrown within the process if they are identified here.</p>

<a name="receiveactivity"></a><h3><img src="images/receive_activity_icon.jpg" width="44" height="42" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="icon" />Receive Activity</h3>
<p>The Receive Activity provides the entry point into the process. The caller will invoke the process by providing it with a message. That message is stored in the variable selected in the activity’s configuration screen. Only variables of type <strong>message</strong> can be used. There can only be one Receive activity in a process.</p>
<p><img src="images/receive_activity_editor.jpg" width="631" height="69" alt="Receive Activity Editor" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Receive Activity Editor</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="replyactivity"></a><h3><img src="images/receive_activity_icon.jpg" width="44" height="42" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="icon" />Reply Activity</h3>
<p>The Reply Activity provides the exit point from a process. Every flow through the process must have one and only one Reply Activity. This means if there are multiple branches created from a <a href="#branchactivity">Branch Activity</a>, each branch must be terminated with a Reply Activity. The Reply Activity can return a message to the caller. It is not required for one-way operation processes. Only variables of type <strong>message</strong> can be used.</p>
<p><img src="images/reply_activity_editor.jpg" width="630" height="68" alt="Reply Activity Editor" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Reply Activity Editor</p>
<h5>Application and Binding Faults</h5>
<p>In addition to specifying the variable holding the message to return you can also indicate that the message is a fault by providing a Fault Name. Faults fall into two main categories:</p>

<ul class="usingOrderedList">

<li><strong>Application faults</strong>: An application fault is caused by a problem in the business process of the operation. For example, if the operation is to withdraw funds, there might be an application fault to identify that there are insufficient funds.</li>
<li><strong>Binding faults</strong>: A binding fault is not specific to the business function of the operation; it is a problem at the protocol layer itself. Binding faults are general to all operations. Some examples: security failures, communication failures, or message parsing errors.</li>

</ul>

<p>An application fault will be defined in the WSDL document for the operation. Policies can be attached to them. A binding fault is typically not referenced anywhere. In the Reply Activity Editor, a Fault Name pull-down is provided that contains the application faults found in the WSDL document for the operation as well as a reserved fault name of <strong>BindingFault</strong>. You can choose what the message being returned represents. One other option is provided that is called <strong>CurrentFault</strong>. That option is available only in the Fault Sequence Editor. It requires the reserved fault variable to be filled with a message and its fault name to be already known and used here.</p>
<p><img src="images/fault_reply_activity.jpg" width="630" height="151" alt="Fault Reply Activity" /></p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>


<a name="invokeactivity"></a><h3><img src="images/invoke_activity_icon.jpg" width="41" height="38" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="icon" /> Invoke Activity</h3>
<p>The Invoke Activity invokes an operation of a service registered in the system. The operation is invoked by sending it a message that is specified using a single input variable or multiple input parameters. The response from the operation invocation is stored in an output variable. These variables can be configured on the Manage Input/Output Parameters screen.</p>
<p>The operation that will get invoked can be specified either statically or dynamically through the use of variables. To statically identify the operation to invoke, first start by searching for the service that includes the operation.</p>
<p>The search is performed using QNames. When the Search button is clicked, the system searches for any service with a QName that contains what is typed in the Service QName field. If nothing is entered, all services are returned.</p>
<p><img src="images/invoked_service_search_pm8x.jpg" width="504" height="85" alt="Invoked Service Search" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Invoked Service Search</p>
<p>Variables can be used for specifying the service, interface, and/or operation. The variable must be a string typed variable.</p>
<p><img src="images/Invoke_Activity_Variables_8x.jpg" width="519" height="128" alt="Static Operation Selection" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Static Operation Selection</p>
<p>By default, the access point (endpoint) that is called when invoking the operation is selected by the runtime container using its selection strategy.</p>
<p><img src="images/invoke_activity_access_point_8x.jpg" width="545" height="109" alt="Direct Access Point Invocation" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Direct Access Point Invocation</p>
<p>Auditing the message as it is sent over the wire to the access point can be achieved by simply selecting the Audit checkbox. The virtual service operation invocation that is executing the process must be currently being audited by use of an auditing policy for the downstream message to be audited.</p>
<h4>Manage Input/Output Parameters</h4>
<p>An invocation activity must define where inputs to the invocation will come from and where the output to the invocation is held within the process.</p>
<p>An operation may have 0 or more parameters, or message parts that must be provided input values. Depending on the protocol used these parameters can be encoded differently.</p>
<p>By default a single message can be used as input using the Single Input Message option. The runtime engine will construct protocol messages using a default mapping of parameters from the single input message according to protocol specific rules. In cases where there are multiple input parameters that cannot be constructed using the default mapping one can directly specify values for each parameter with the Multiple Input Parameters option.</p>
<p>When choosing the Multiple Input Parameters option, variables in the process can be identified as the inputs to the parameters/parts defined for the operation. Each parameter of the operation is listed in the Parameters table. A variable can be selected from the drop down in the same row to populate the parameter. If a variable is not assigned to a parameter the runtime engine will attempt to perform its own mapping for that parameter.</p>
<p><img src="images/invoke_activity_manage_input_output1_8x.jpg" width="615" height="192" alt="Input" /></p>
<p>A single output message is returned from an invocation. A variable can be selected to hold that output for later use within the process.</p>
<p><img src="images/invoke_activity_manage_input_output2_8x.jpg" width="607" height="60" alt="Variable for output message" /></p>

<h4>Manage Outbound Identities</h4>
<p>You can configure whether you want to use incoming identities as outbound identities (the default), or specify custom identities to be used for all outbound messages to the downstream service on the <strong>Manage Outbound Identities</strong> screen.</p>
<p>When securing outbound calls from a virtual service, identities will typically be required to be specified in request messages. Those identities can be categorized as different actors in a message exchange.</p>
<p>The <strong>Use Incoming Identities as Outbound Identities</strong> option is selected by default. This means identities used when invoking the operation are dictated by the outbound identity configuration of the virtual service.</p>
<p>You can also define identities for outgoing messages in the <strong>Specify Outbound Identities</strong> section. Added identities are stored in an Identity Table where they can be modified or deleted. Perform the configuration tasks as needed (Add, Modify, or Delete).</p>
<p><img src="images/invoke_activity_manage_outbound_identities_8x.jpg" width="539" height="295" alt="Manage outbound identities" /></p>

<h4>Assign Parameter Values from Script</h4>
<p>You can also specify parameters, or parts using the following methods:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li><strong>getPart (String);</strong>&#8212;Adds a value for a part (parameter) with the given name.</li>
  <li><strong>addPart (String, Object part)</strong>&#8212;Removes the value for the part (parameter) with the given name.</li>
  <li><strong>removePart (String);</strong>&#8212;Returns the names of all parts (parameters) that have been assigned a value.</li>
  <li><strong>getPartNames()</strong>&#8212;&#8212;Returns the names of all parts (parameters) that have been assigned a value</li>
</ul>

<a name="scriptactivity"></a><h3><img src="images/script_activity_icon.jpg" width="39" height="34" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="icon" />Script Activity</h3>
<p>The Script Activity provides the ability to execute a script at the point in the process the activity is connected. The script can be written in JavaScript, Jython, or BeanShell.
</p>
<p>The Script Details Editor is organized into two separate areas, Imports and Source. The Source has a pull-down where you can select the script language. It also has a large source code editor text area.</p>
<p><img src="images/script_activity_source_area.jpg" width="591" height="140" alt="Script Activity Source Area" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Script Activity Source Area</p>
<p>Common functions that you may need to perform in your scripts can be saved in Script objects using the <strong>Add Script</strong> function in the <em>Scripts</em> section of each Organization in the Policy Manager Workbench. To make use of those common functions from the Script Activity, the Script objects defining those functions must be imported. The Imports area is where those scripts are identified for import. The available scripts are listed in the Available Scripts tree. Any number of Scripts in that tree can be moved to the Imported Scripts list box. Only scripts that match the language type are available for selection in the tree. The script does not return a value.</p>
<p><img src="images/script_activity_imports_area.jpg" width="572" height="174" alt="Script Activity Imports Area" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Script Activity Imports Area</p>
<p>In the figure above the json2 script from the Registry Scripts folder is imported. Any functions defined in json2 can be used within the Script Activity source code.
</p>
<p>The following pre-defined variables are provided. For more information, refer to the Policy Manager Scripting API located in the docs\scriptDocs folder of the Policy Manager 8.x release folder.</p>
<p>You can access the scripting API for your Policy Manager version here: <a href="http://docs.akana.com/ag/assets/scriptDocs_pm80/index.html" >Policy Manager 8.x</a></p>

<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li><strong>processContext</strong> – Provides functions for retrieving and changing information about the currently running process, such as the variables defined in the process and the authenticated subjects of the process.</li>
  <li><strong>systemLog</strong> – Provides logging functions to the container&rsquo;s log. The statements logged with this interface are mixed with the other system log statements.</li>
  <li><strong>auditLog</strong> – Provides logging functions to the process audit log. If auditing is enabled for the virtual service operation that is invoking the process, statements logged using this variable log information is inserted into the audited message log for the operation&rsquo;s execution. This can be found on the service&rsquo;s Monitoring tab in the Logs sub-tab.</li>
  <li><strong>alerter</strong> – Provides an interface for generating alerts that are displayed in on the Policy Manager alert pages.</li>
  <li><strong>recorder</strong> – Provides an interface for recording content in the Policy Manager usage log pages.</li>
  <li><strong>msgFactory</strong> – Providers functions for create message variables. A message variable cannot simply be assigned content such as a simple string or int variable. It must be initialized using one of the functions in the msgFactory.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Normalized Copy Example</h5>
<p>The following is a script that creates a normalized copy of a message and saves it as a variable.</p>
<p><img src="images/script_activity_message1.jpg" width="589" height="39" alt="normalized message copy" /></p>

<p>On line 1 the processContext is used to get the message variable named <strong>message</strong>. On line 2 a normalized copy is made of the message. Finally on line 3 the processContext is used to save the normalized copy as a variable named <strong>copy</strong> that can be used in other activities that execute after this one in the process.</p>
<h5>Normalized Message Creation Example</h5>

<p>The next script illustrates the use of the msgFactory to create a normalized message. A normalized message contains the XML element referenced in the wsdl:Message element in a WSDL document.</p>

<p><img src="images/script_activity_message2.jpg" width="613" height="67" alt="Using msgFactory to create a normalized message" /></p>
<p>On line 3 the msgFactory is used to create a normalized message named temp. On line 4 the content from line 1 is set as the temp message content. On line 5 the processContext is used to save the new message as a variable named temp.</p>

<h5>Protocol Message Creation Example</h5>

<p>Message creation is not limited to normalized messages. Protocol-specific messages of any content-type can be constructed using the msgFactory. The following example shows the creation of a JSON message.</p>
<p><img src="images/script_activity_message3.jpg" width="602" height="65" alt="Script activity message" /></p>
<p>Note on line 2 the call on the msgFactory to create the message is different, both in function name and the need for specifying the content-type of the message, application/json in this case.</p>

<a name="branchactivity"></a><h3><img src="images/branch_activity_icon.jpg" width="31" height="24" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="icon" /> Branch Activity</h3>
<p>The Branch Activity provides a mechanism to have alternate process flows, or branches, based on boolean conditions. Drop the Branch Activity on the Process page and connect the last activity to be executed before the branch to the Branch Activity.</p>
<p><img src="images/adding_a_branch_activity.jpg" width="262" height="140" alt="Adding a Branch Activity" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Adding a Branch Activity</p>
<p>The Branch Activity itself has very little configuration. It is the branch conditions themselves that have most of the information. If you double-click on the Branch Activity you can see a list of the conditions and most importantly you can establish what expression language each branch condition will use. All branch conditions must use the same language. The supported languages are XPath, JavaScript, Jython, BeanShell, or Simple Expressions.</p>
<p><img src="images/branch_activity_editor.jpg" width="577" height="162" alt="Branch Activity Editor" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Branch Activity Editor</p>
<p>To create a branch, add the next activity to be performed to the process graph, and then select the Branch Activity and connect it to the next activity.</p>
<p><img src="images/creating_a_branch.jpg" width="487" height="160" alt="Creating a Branch" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Creating a Branch</p>
<p>A Branch Activity is similar to a Java switch statement. It can support multiple branches. Only one branch is followed. The branches have boolean conditions defined by either an XPath expression or a script. Each branch is evaluated in order. The first to evaluate to true is selected and the sequence of activities associated with the branch is performed.</p>
<p>Branch conditions are defined separately from the main Branch Activity in the Condition Details Editor. You add a branch condition by adding a new activity to the sequence (for example, a Script Activity or Invoke Activity) and dragging a connector from the main Branch Activity to the target activity. There must always be a default branch that can be selected if no other branch conditions evaluate to true. This default branch condition is named <strong>Otherwise</strong> and must be added and set for each Branch Activity configuration.</p>
<p>A branch condition can be written in any of the languages in the drop-down. It is set in the Branch Details Editor and can only be changed there. The language selected will apply to all conditions within the branch.</p>
<p>Note that if you have branch conditions defined and you choose to change the language, all source is deleted. If you want to change the language, make a copy of your source content first.</p>
<p>After you select the language for case conditions, you then save and exit your Branch Activity and add your connections.</p>
<p>The result of the condition must be either true or false. If there are multiple conditions for a branch, the order in which they are executed can be changed by moving each condition up or down in the Case Conditions table. Note that the <strong>Otherwise</strong> condition does not display in the Case Conditions table but must still be defined.</p>

<p>The first branch created in most cases becomes the Otherwise branch although that can be changed. To change a branch&rsquo;s condition double-click the connector between the Branch Activity and the next activity in the branch sequence. The branch condition can be written in XPath, JavaScript, Jython, or BeanShell. The result of the condition must be either true or false.</p>
<p><img src="images/branch_condition_editor.jpg" width="521" height="371" alt="Branch Condition Editor" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Branch Condition Editor</p>
<p>In the illustration above, the condition is configured to use XPath as the language for the Boolean expression. The expression checks for the first price element found in the content of the message named <strong>message</strong> and if its value is greater than 100 then this condition is met. Note the namespace prefix is defined at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<p>When using XPath as the expression language, a field for selecting a message variable to use as the context of the expression is displayed. The expression is evaluated against that variable’s content. The variable’s content must be XML or an error is generated at runtime.</p>
<p>When using a script language, the script is evaluated and the last line of execution is expected to result in a boolean true or false. The context of the script is provided with a subset of the variables described in the Script Activity above:</p>

<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li><strong>processContext</strong>&#8212;Provides functions for retrieving and changing information about the currently running process, such as the variables defined in the process and one or more authenticated subjects of the process.</li>
  <li><strong>systemLog</strong>&#8212;Provides logging functions to the container&rsquo;s log. The statements logged with this interface are mixed with the other system log statements.</li>
  <li><strong>auditLog</strong> – Provides logging functions to the process audit log. If auditing is enabled for the virtual service operation that is invoking the process, statements logged using this variable are inserted into the audited message log for the operation&rsquo;s execution. This can be found on the service&rsquo;s <em>Monitoring</em> tab in the <em>Logs</em> sub-tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following figure the condition is triggered when the value of the price variable is greater than 100.</p>

<a name="splitactivity"></a><h3><img src="images/split-32px.gif" width="31" height="24" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="icon" /> Split Activity</h3>
<p>The Split Activity provides a mechanism to split the process into multiple concurrent flows, or branches. Drop the Split Activity on the Process page and connect the last activity to be executed before the split to the Split Activity.</p>
<p><img src="images/adding_a_split_activity.jpg" width="262" height="120" alt="Adding a Split Activity" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Adding a Split Activity</p>
<p>When the activity that connects to the Split activity completes the process engine will execute all flows originating from the Split activity in parallel with their own threads. Each flow can have any of the activities
 from the palette except those that would prematurely end the flow of execution before a required Join activity, such as a Reply activity. It is recommended that the same process variable not be used
 from different flows because it can lead to unpredictable results. All flows that originate from the Split activity must be terminated by the same Join activity. All flows will execute
 concurrently and then wait for each other to finish before resuming execution after the Join activity.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="joinactivity"></a><h3><img src="images/join-32px.gif" width="31" height="24" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="Join Activity" /> Join Activity</h3>
<p>The Join Activity terminates multiple concurrent flows, or branches. Drop the Join Activity on the Process page and connect the last activity in each of the concurrent flows originating from a Join activity to the Split activity.</p>
<p><img src="images/adding_a_join_activity.jpg" width="262" height="190" alt="Adding a Join Activity" /></p>

<p>All flows originating from a Split activity must be terminated by the same Join activity. The activity after the Join activity is executed in the same thread as the originating
Split activity, but it will not execute until all the flows complete their execution.</p>

<a name="transformationactivity"></a><h3><img src="images/transformation_activity_icon.jpg" width="40" height="36" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="icon" />Transformation Activity</h3>
<p>The Transformation Activity provides a mechanism for transforming XML message or string content. The transformation is based on XSLT. The input to the activity can be a message or string variable. At the completion of the activity, the transformed content replaces the input variable content.</p>
<p><img src="images/transformation_activity_example.jpg" width="581" height="301" alt="Transformation Activity Example" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Transformation Activity Example</p>
<p>In the figure above, the XSL stylesheet will remove the BankId element and prefix the account id of each account with the bank id. </p>
<p>The example below shows an example of the transformation for a specific content example.</p>

<a name="auditactivity"></a><h3><img src="images/Audit Activity Icon.jpg" width="28" height="29" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="icon" /> Audit Activity</h3>
<p>The Audit Activity provides a mechanism for auditing a message. The audited message content is recorded and displayed as audited message content from an Auditing Policy. This information displays on the <em>Monitoring</em> pages of a service (Services &gt; Monitoring). The input to the activity can be a message variable.</p>
<p>There are several options for what portion of the message variable content will be audited. In the Capture Details section of the Activity Editor there are two primary options; to capture the <em>complete</em> message or a <em>portion</em> of the message. </p>
<p><img src="images/auditing_complete_message.jpg" width="601" height="115" alt="Auditing Complete Message" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Auditing Complete Message</p>
<p>If the <strong>Capture complete message</strong> option is selected, it's only necessary to specify a record name or label. If the <strong>Capture message at the following expressions</strong> option is selected, you can enter a list of expressions.</p>
<p><img src="images/auditing_portions_of_message.jpg" width="534" height="219" alt="Auditing Portions of Message" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Auditing Portions of Message</p>
<p>Each expression can use a different language. The supported languages are XPath, JSONPath, and Regular Expression. The XPath expressions are used when the input content is XML. The JSONPath expressions are used when the input content is JSON. The Regular Expressions are used for all other types of content. Each expression has its own Record Name, or label.</p>
<p>In case there is content that should not be viewable by others in the audit log, there is an option for masking content. In the Masked Elements section, you specify a mask (for example, password or account number) and a list of expressions that identify the content to be masked.</p>
<p><img src="images/masking_audited_elements.jpg" width="576" height="235" alt="Masking Audited Elements" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Masking Audited Elements</p>
<p>The expressions in the Masked Elements section are similar to those in the Capture Details section. The same languages are supported for masking and the same mapping of message content type to expression language. The results of the expressions are replaced by the mask string.</p>
<p>If we look at the entire activity definition we can see that we are auditing just the account elements/properties of XML and JSON messages but we are masking out the account ids with a mask of *******.</p>
<p><img src="images/audit_activity_example.jpg" width="497" height="548" alt="Audit Activity Example" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Audit Activity Example</p>
<p>Note the XPath expressions require namespace prefix definitions that are specified at the bottom of the editor.</p>

<a name="insertcontentactivity"></a><h3><img src="images/insert_content_activity_icon.jpg" width="45" height="37" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="icon" />Insert Content Activity</h3>
<p>The Insert Content Activity can be used to fill the content of a String or Message variable. The source of the content can be either statically defined content or an existing variable.</p>
<p>The From section of the activity editor identifies the source of the content. To specify static content to be inserted, select the Static Content radio button. Once you select the button, a text area is displayed where you can enter content of any type, such as XML, JSON, or text. A text field is also displayed where you must enter the mime content type of the static content you entered in the text area (for example, application/xml or application/json). </p>
<p><img src="images/static_content.jpg" width="537" height="232" alt="Static Content" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Static Content</p>
<p>To use content from a variable as input, select the Variable radio button. Once selected, a Filter section is displayed. To insert only a specific portion of the variable's content, select the <strong>Filter</strong> check box. To insert the entire content of the variable, leave the checkbox cleared.</p>
<p>A filter is defined using a filter expression written in a selected language. The languages supported are XPath (for XML content), JSONPath (for JSON content), or Regular Expression (for any content). The result of the filter expression applied to the input variable will be inserted. It is possible that the filter expression results in multiple elements or properties being used as input.</p>
<p><img src="images/filtered_variable_content.jpg" width="571" height="173" alt="Filtered Variable Content" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Filtered Variable Content</p>
<p>When defining XPath filter expressions, you must include the namespaces of specified elements. That is done by using a namespace prefix in the expression. All namespace prefixes must be mapped to a namespace in the Namespace Prefixes table at the bottom of the activity page.</p>
<p><img src="images/namespace_prefixes.jpg" width="568" height="117" alt="Namespace Prefixes" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Namespace Prefixes</p>
<p>The To section of the activity identifies the target of the content specified in the From section. The target of the inserted content must be a variable. The From content can initialize or replace the content of the variable in the To section, or it can be inserted into the existing content of the target variable. If replacing the entire content of a variable, if the variable has not yet been initialized it is initialized as a result of the activity.</p>
<p>To insert into existing content, the target location must be identified using a filter similar to the one described in the To section. Based on the filter expression, it is possible that multiple target locations can be found.</p>
<p>Once you've identified the target location, you can specify one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The source content is inserted/added at the specified location (click <strong>Append</strong> button).</li>
  <li>The source content replaces existing content at the specified location (click <strong>Replace</strong> button).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using a regular expression, only the Replace option is available.</p>
<p><img src="images/filtered_content_target.jpg" width="554" height="146" alt="Filtered Content Target" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Filtered Content Target</p>
<p>The following figure illustrates the use of the Insert Content activity to initialize a message with static XML content.</p>
<p><img src="images/static_content_example.jpg" width="512" height="465" alt="Static Content Example" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Static Content Example</p>
<p>Since no filter is defined in the To section the static XML content will replace the content of var1, but if var1 has not yet been initialized in the process the static XML content is used to initialize var1.</p>
<p>The next figure illustrates using the Insert Content Activity to extract a portion of a source variable and append it to a target variable in a specified location.</p>
<p><img src="images/append_content_example.jpg" width="549" height="424" alt="Append Content Example" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Append Content Example</p>
<p>All account elements in the message variable will be appended to the accounts element in var1. If no accounts element is found at the root of var1 an error will be generated. To see how this activity would perform at runtime, take the following content for the message variable:</p>
<p><img src="images/insert_content_activity_message1.jpg" width="550" height="229" alt="Message variable content" /></p>
<p>And the following content for the var1 variable:</p>
<p><img src="images/insert_content_activity_message2.jpg" width="512" height="15" alt="Var variable content" /></p>
<p>As a result of the activity var1 would have the following content:</p>

<a name="processactivity"></a><h3><img src="images/process_activity_icon.jpg" width="41" height="40" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="icon" /> Process Activity</h3>
<p>The Process Activity allows you to call one process from another so that you can create processes with common activities and then call those processes at an appropriate point of another process. These processes with common activities are reusable and are organized in the <em>Processes</em> folder of each Organization in the Policy Manager Workbench. Reusable processes can themselves have Process activities so that they can call other reusable processes.</p>
<p>The configuration of a Process Activity is simple. The editor presents a tree of reusable processes in the <em>Processes</em> folder of each Organization in the Policy Manager Workbench. You simply select one.</p>
<p><img src="images/process_activity_editor.jpg" width="550" height="222" alt="Process Activity Editor" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Process Activity Editor</p>

<p>When a process is called from another process, the calling process’s context is passed to the called process. All the variables and their values from the calling process are passed through. If the called process defines variables with the same names as ones in the calling process, the calling process’s variables are used.</p>



<a name="throwactivity"></a><h3><img src="images/throw_activity_icon.jpg" width="30" height="29" style="vertical-align:bottom" alt="icon" /> Throw Activity</h3>
<p>The Throw Activity exits the current flow of activities and enters the fault flow. You can add a Throw Activity at any point in the process (not in the fault flow). At the conclusion of the Throw Activity the current flow will be terminated and either the fault flow defined for the thrown fault will be executed (if defined) or the default flow will be executed.</p>
<p>The Throw Details Editor allows you to configure the Throw Activity. Here you define a Fault Name, and the message variable can be identified as the fault message.</p>
<p><img src="images/throw_activity_editor.jpg" width="617" height="103" alt="Throw Details Editor" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Throw Details Editor</p>
<p><img src="images/throw_activity_illustration.jpg" width="638" height="363" alt="Adding a Throw Activity" /></p>
<p>Illustration: Adding a Throw Activity</p>
<p>The Throw Activity is defined by the fault it throws and optionally a message containing information about the fault.</p>
<p>If there is a fault flow constructed for the fault with the given name the flow will be executed. If there is not, the default, or unnamed fault flow, will be executed. The variable identifies a message variable in the process that holds the contents of the fault. It is assigned to the standard <strong>fault</strong> variable that is used in the default Reply activity of fault flows.</p>
