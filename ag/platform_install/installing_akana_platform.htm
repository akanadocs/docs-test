<h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p>The Akana Platform is a OSGI environment that Akana features are designed to run within, obey its constraints, and make use of its facilities. The platform supports Windows and  UNIX (Linux, Solaris, AIX) environments, and is installed using an extractable zip file. The Win-JRE and Linux-JRE zip files include a JRE if you do not want to download one. The Platform zip file can work anywhere but you must download and install your own JRE.
<p>After installing the platform, feature zip files can  be extracted to the platform, and then installed and configured using the <em>Akana Administration Console</em>.


<h3>Step 1: Download Akana Platform Zip File</h3>
<p>Download an Akana Platform self-extracting zip file from the <em>Akana Customer Support Site</em>: </p>
<ol class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Launch www.support.akana.com</li>
  <li>Go to<em> Downloads &gt; Akana Platform &gt; 8.0</em>.</li>
  <li>Download a  platform zip file:
    <p><strong>akana-platform-linux-jre-8.0.xxx.zip</strong> (Linux only - includes JRE)</p>
    <p><strong>akana-platform-win-jre-8.0.xxx.zip</strong> (Windows only - includes JRE)<br />
      <br />
    <strong>akana-platform-8.0.xxx.zip</strong>    (Does not include JRE. Can be used for Windows, Linux, Solaris, Windows only - includes JRE).</p>
  </li>

<h3>Step 2: Install Akana Platform Zip File</h3></a>
<ol class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Extract the platform zip file to a new or existing folder. The directory structure will look similar to the following:<br />
    <br />
  <em><img src="images/akana_platform_dir.JPG" width="585" height="187" /></em>  </li>
  <li>The following table provides a brief description of Akana Platform folder. <br />
    <br />
    <table width="706" cellspacing="0px" class="doctable">
      <thead>
      </thead>
      <tr>
        <th width="188">Folder Name</th>
        <th width="471">Description</th>
        <td width="33"></thead></td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="t2row">
        <td height="26">\bin</td>
        <td><p>Includes the Akana Platform shell and  batch scripts. This includes Start /Stop scripts for all the Akana  Platform processes, scripts used to register and un-register Windows services,  and scripts for launching the Akana Platform administration and configuration  wizards. This folder also includes a script run the Akana Platform product  as a unique Cron job.</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="t1row">
        <td height="26">\config</td
    >
        <td class="t1Row"><p>Includes Akana Platform properties files. These property  files are reserved for system use.</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="t2row">
        <td height="30">\instances</td>
        <td>
        <p>A  runtime created folder. After the platform is installed, the initial \instances folder includes config.properties and system.properties files. </p>
        <p>When you launch and complete the Configure Container Instance Wizard, a Configurator folder is created that includes the following sub-folders. </p>
        <ul class="usingOrderedList">
          <li><strong>asynchworkflow</strong> – Stores code  samples for platform APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>\cache</strong> - Stores OSGI  bundles for installed features.</li>
  <li><strong>\deploy</strong> - Includes properties files (com.soa.config.cfg and com.soa.log.cfg)  that include Akana Platform default configuration  settings. These files are used to push default configuration information to the  Administration Console and are typically for one-time use only. These  properties pushed to the Administration Console can be updated via the  &quot;Configuration&quot; tab. Bundles and other .cfg files can also be added  to the \deploy folder and will be published to the Administration Console.  These properties can also be updated via the &quot;Configuration&quot; tab.</li>
  <li><strong>\log</strong> - Stores log files that are automatically generated when an Akana Platform  function is operating. The logging process  records the actions performed for each Akana Platform function and stores the information in the log  file. Log files can be archived for historical record based on your  requirements.</li>
</ul>
        <p>Each time a new container instance is  created a new folder is created using the assigned container name. For example, if you installed the Policy Manager zip file and named the container instance the associated folder will include the following folders:</p>
        <ul class="usingOrderedList">
          <li><strong>asynchworkflow</strong> – Stores code  samples for platform APIs.</li>
          <li><strong>\cache</strong> - Stores OSGI  bundles for installed features.</li>
          <li>\cachedir - </li>
          <li><strong>\cm – </strong>Stores configuration data associated with Akana Administration  Console &quot;Configure&quot; tab. </li>
          <li><strong>\deploy</strong> - Includes properties files (com.soa.config.cfg and com.soa.log.cfg)  that include Akana Platform default configuration  settings. These files are used to push default configuration information to the  Administration Console and are typically for one-time use only. These  properties pushed to the Administration Console can be updated via the  &quot;Configuration&quot; tab.
