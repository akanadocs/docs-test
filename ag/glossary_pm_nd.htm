<dt>Binding</dt>
<dd>A binding is reference to an external framework (interface) that defines how the WSDL user will reach the implementation of services. This reference specifies the protocol and data format to be used in the transmitting message defined by the associated interface.</dd>
<dd>Each binding technique is specified in the WSDL and points to the server that has access to the actual implementation of your Web service. Policy Manager provides an extensible WSDL Binding framework that supports out-of-the-box Binding implementations and custom Binding implementations. The Binding Framework includes API's and extensions points in both the SOA Containers and the Policy Manager user interface. The <strong>SOA Container</strong> and <strong>Policy Manager Console</strong> portions of the framework are independent of each other however. In some situations, only the user interface of the <strong>Policy Manager Console</strong> is extended for a type of binding. This is the case when an <strong>SOA Container</strong> is not used to virtualize services using the binding. Bindings drive the service management process and must be present and available when defining and managing service configurations. Because of this, Bindings must be added to the <strong>Policy Manager Console</strong> as a prerequisite to using the various service management wizards and access point functionality. SOAP 1.1, SOAP 1.2, HTTP, and POX (Plain Old XML) binding types are supported. If the specified interface does not contain one of the three binding types, a custom binding can be specified by supplying the appropriate XML.</dd>
<dd>CATEGORY: Policy Manager, Service Management</dd>


<dt>Binding Template</dt>
<dd>A Binding Template designates that the accessPoint contains a bindingKey that points to a different bindingTemplate entry. The Binding Template is generally used when a business or entity wants to expose a service description and the service is described in a separate bindingTemplate record.</dd>


<dt id="gl_pm_bpel_engine">BPEL</dt>
<dd>BPEL is an abbreviation for Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL), an OASIS standard executable language which is a standard format for specifying actions within a business process, used by web services.</dd>


<dt>Browse Categories</dt>
<dd>Browse Categories is a Policy Manager <strong>Registry</strong> search option that provides a method of viewing business services or providers that are associated with a particular category scheme. This search option is useful if you are trying to determine an appropriate category scheme to associate with a business provider or service you are defining.</dd>

	<dd>A Workbench Object is an element in an Organization Tree that contains a specific type of a <strong>metrics</strong> information pertaining to the web service. Metrics information for each object includes configuration, security (access control and policy), attribute, and state information. Objects that display in the <strong>Organization Tree</strong> are first-class objects meaning that they can be used in Workbench without restriction and have intrinsic identity. The first-class object is a complete entity unto itself, includes all the privileges and properties, and can be passed to functions and returned from them. Core functionality of the first-class object is presented in the Workbench as <strong>Portlets.</strong> External attribute information related to a particular function is via tabs.</dd>

	<dt>WS-Auditing Policy</dt>
	<dd>An auditing policy provides instructions to an SOA Container for when to audit information about messages, what information to audit, and how to report the information. The following WS-Auditing Policies are supported: WS-Auditing Message Policy, WS-Auditing SOAP Message Policy, WS-Auditing SOAP Service Policy, WS-Auditing Service Policy, and WS-Auditing Transaction Tracking Policy.</dd>
	<dd>CATEGORY: Policies</dd>


	<dt>WS-Security</dt>
	<dd>WS-Security is a mechanism for incorporating security information into SOAP messages. WS-Security builds from the SOAP specification, structuring the use of essential security capabilities by using binary tokens for authentication, digital signatures for integrity, and content-level encryption for confidentiality. By structuring SOAP security, WS-Security makes it easy to include security elements into SOAP through tools and enterprise applications.</dd>

	<dt>WS-Security Symmetric Binding Policy</dt>
	<dd>The WS-Security Symmetric Binding Policy is used when only one party needs to generate the security tokens. A symmetric key is established using that security token and further signing and encrypting is done using this.
		For example, symmetric binding can be used when only the server possesses an X509 Token.</dd>
	<dd>CATEGORY: Policies</dd>


	<dt>WS-Security Transport Binding Policy</dt>
	<dd>The WS-Security Transport Binding Policy is used when the message protection is provided by the transport medium. Most common scenario is using HTTPS as the message exchange transport medium.</dd>
	<dd>In transport binding assertion, we can define a transport token through which we can constrain messages to be exchanged only through a defined medium. WS-Security policy specification defines a HTTPS token that defines messages be transmitted over HTTPS.</dd>
