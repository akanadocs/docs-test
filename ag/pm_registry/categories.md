## About Categories

The Policy Manager default installation includes a default category hierarchy that includes industry specific and custom category schemes. Category schemes must be defined before they can be added to the category hierarchy (see [Add Category Schemes](category_schemes.html)).

To view the categories summary, including a browse-able Category Hierarchy, in the *Management Console*, go to **Configure > Registry** and then click the **Categories** tab.

## Navigate Category Hierarchy

1. Go to **Configure > Registry**.
2. Click on the **Categories Tab**.  
The *Categories Summary* screen displays.  
**Notes**: 
  * *The Category Hierarchy tree is used to structure the defined category schemes. These Category Schemes are associated with business providers or services to facilitate the discovery process.* 
  * *Each element in the Category Hierarchy is attached to one or more elements directly below it.* 
  * *The top of the Category Hierarchy is referred to as the "root."* 
  * *Each Category Scheme included in the Category Hierarchy is considered a "branch."* 
  * *Clicking a Category Scheme reveals its subcategories.* 
  * *You can drill down into the sub-levels to view the information and how it is organized.* 
  * *Subcategories at the very bottom (with no elements below them) are called "leaves."*

## Add Sub Category

The process of building your category taxonomy involves defining a standard set of subcategoriesâ€”referred to as topics. After your standard set of topics are defined, you can sub-categorize your "topics" (referred to as "subject categories"). There are a variety of different industry-based categorization templates and guidelines pertaining to development of category taxonomies that are useful reference points.

To build a category taxonomy using the Registry Categories feature, you must define a "Key Name" and "Key Value" for each subcategory (or subject category) definition. The "Key Name" represents the subcategory name that will display in the Category Hierarchy. The "Key Value" is the internal system reference name of the subcategory.

**Note:** *Updating the default set of category schemes is not recommended and not supported. Akana advises against any modifications since it may impact the functionality of the product. This includes the industry-focused set of category schemes, and the Service Manager category schemes.*

After you have the necessary information, you can follow the steps below to Add a Subcategory.

1. Go to **Configure > Registry**.
2. Click on the **Categories Tab**.  
The *Categories Summary* screen displays.
