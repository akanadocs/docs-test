<h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p>In previous Policy Manager versions, a cluster of Network Director (ND) instances worked independently. This means if the policy only allowed 10 requests per minute each node (instance) in an ND cluster would allow 10 requests per minute. Data was not synchronized across clusters (e.g., ND1 processed 2 requests, so there are 8 counts left, etc.).</p>
<p>  Beginning with Policy Manager version 7.2, the processing of requests can now be synchronized across a cluster of multiple ND instances within a single deployment by creating a <em>clusterable cache</em>. A clusterable cache is memory that different processes can share. </p>
<p>  For example, if you want the entire cluster to collectively only allow 10 requests per minute you can configure the ND&rsquo;s to share memory (i.e., a clusterable cache) which will hold information using counters. Then when one node receives a message and increments a counter, it&rsquo;s the same counter the other nodes are using.</p>
<p>A clusterable cache can be used with the following policies:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li> <strong>Throughput Quota Policy</strong> - Allows you to monitor a policy by specifying a throughput limit (i.e., quota) and queue size.</li>
  <li> <strong>Bandwidth Quota Policy</strong> - Allows you to monitor a policy by specifing a <span xml:lang="EN" lang="en">bandwidth cap that can be specified as kilobytes   or megabytes per second.</span></li>
  <li><strong>WS-Security Policies</strong> - Using a clusterable cache, you can share nonces to prevent getting duplicate messages across all ND's in a cluster. Supported WS-Security policies include WS-Security Message, WS-Security Asymmetric Binding, and WS-Security Transport policies. </li>
</ul>
<p>  You configure a clusterable cache by updating a series of configuration categories in the <em>SOA Software Administration Console &gt; Configuration</em> section. The process involves setting up the clusterable cache using the <strong>com.soa.grid</strong> property, and then configuring properties for the  <em>Throughput Quota Policy</em>, <em>Bandwidth Quota Policy</em>, and <em>WS-Security Policies</em> to use the clustered cache. </p>

<h3>How do I Create a  Clusterable Cache and use it in a Policy? </h3>
</a>
<p>Perform the following steps for each Network Director instance. </p>
<h4>Step 1: Create Clusterable Cache</h4>
<ol class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Select <strong>com.soa.grid</strong>.</li>
  <li>Set <strong>grid.network.config.enableMulticast </strong>to <strong>false</strong>, and <strong>grid.network.config.enableTcp</strong> to <strong>true</strong>. <em>Note that the Multicast option (grid.network.config.enableMulticast) is currently not supported. </em><br />
    <br />
    <img src="images/config_soagrid.jpg" alt="" width="646" height="393" /><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>In <strong>grid.network.config.peerAddresses</strong>, specify the peer address of each Network Director instance in your deployment. Omit the peer address of the current Network Director instance in the list. </li>
  <li>After completing your entries, <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Step 2: Use Clustered Cache  in Throughput Quota,  Bandwidth Quota, and WS-Security <strong>Asymmetric Binding</strong> Policies</h4>
<ol class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Launch the <em>SOA Software Administration Console </em>and navigate to the <em>Configuration</em> tab. </li>
  <li>In the <em>Configuration Categories</em> section, you can select properties for the <em>Throughput Quota Policy</em> (<strong>com.soa.policyhandle.quota.throughput</strong>) or  <em>Bandwidth Quota Policy</em> (<strong>com.soa.policy.handle.quota.bandwidth</strong>).</li>
  <li>Change <strong>use.clustered.cache</strong> to <strong>True</strong> and <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.  <br />
    <br />
    <img src="images/use_clustered_cache_throughput.jpg" width="622" height="399" /><br />
  Figure. Throughput Quota Policy 
  (<strong>com.soa.policyhandle.quota.throughput</strong>)<br />
  <br />
  <img src="images/use_clustered_cache_bandwidth.jpg" width="617" height="309" /><br />
  Figure. Bandwidth Quota Policy 
  (<strong>com.soa.policy.handle.quota.bandwidth</strong>)<br />
  <br />
  </li>
  <li>For the WS-Security Policy (<strong>com.soa.policy.handle.wssp.noncecache</strong>), ND will  automatically use the clustered cache if you enabled the Grid and TCP options in Step 1, otherwise the  local cache will be used.&nbsp;<br />

  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Step 3: Restart Network Director Instances</h4>
  <ol class="usingOrderedList">
    <li>Before you can successfully use the clusterable cache, you must restart all Network Director instances after completing the configuration category changes outlined in the previous steps. </li>
  </ol>
<h4>Step 4: Synchronize Clocks </h4>
<ol class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>The Policy Manager clusterable caching logic is based on the system clock. To ensure  there is not a lag in one of the Network Director instances while processing requests, you must synchonize all system clocks so they match (i.e., by milliseconds and seconds).</li>
</ol>
<h4>Step 5: Test Policy Enforcement (Example)</h4>
<p><strong>Throughput Quota  Policy</strong></p>
<ol class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Configure a  Throughput Quota Policy  to process 10 requests per minute.</li>
  <li>Virtualize a service.</li>
  <li>Attach the policy to the virtual service.</li>
  <li>Call the virtual service from the SOAP UI.</li>
  <li>Call the virtual service 10-20 times. </li>
  <li>In approximately one minute, ten requests will be success and the remainder will fail.</li>
  <li>Review the alerts. All requests failed past the 10 requests per minute will show a quota exceeded alert.  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Bandwidth Quota  Policy</strong></p>
<ol class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Configure a Bandwidth Quota Policy with 10 kbps for the Request .</li>
  <li>Virtualize a service.</li>
  <li>Attach the policy to the virtual service.</li>
  <li>In  SOAP UI, run a single test step (e.g, Echo-Request1) in your case and make sure that the response is received  successfully.</li>
  <li>Click on raw tab and note the content length of the request. Lets assume that content length is 1129 bytes. </li>
  <li>Configure your load test's limit as 60 seconds or whatever number of seconds you want. </li>
  <li>After running the test for 60 seconds lets say you see a count of 616 and an error count of 10. In this case the net count is 616-10=606. Ideally you would want to see the error count as 0. Some of these errors might be caused because a backend physical service took too long to return the response and then in this example the  errors should have been included in the net count as ND allowed this request and passed it to physical service. Some of these errors might be caused because all of the ND threads were busy due to high load and in this example errors should not be included in net count. </li>
  <li>So lets assume that the net count is 606. Total number of bytes allowed by ND in 60 seconds-&gt; 606*1129= 684174.</li>
  <li>Total number of bytes allowed per second 684174/60= 11402.9 bytes ~ 10kbps.</li>
</ol>
