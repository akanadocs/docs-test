<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>By default, all DataPower transactions for all managed services must pass contract authorization in order to DataPower to pass the transaction. If contract authorization fails, DataPower will always fail the transaction.</p>
<p>If contracts are not needed for a given managed DataPower service or service operation, they can be disabled via Policy Manager using the DataPower Contracts Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that disabling contracts is a potential security hole, as DataPower will let a transaction succeed even if that transaction would normally fail due to a contract authorization failure.</p>
