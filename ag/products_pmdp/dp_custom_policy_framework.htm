<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The <strong>Akana Policy Manager Custom Policy Framework</strong> feature, provides functionality for adding custom policies to Policy Manager. These policies can then be attached to a service in order to change the behavior of that service at runtime.</p>
<p>The Custom Policy Framework includes a series of sample XML policies that illustrate levels of functionality you can add to a policy definition. Review the sample policies to become familiar with how they are structured and options available to you. You can then deploy the samples and view the user-interface of each policy in the <strong>Policy Manager Management Console</strong> to determine what options you would like to use in your own custom policies.</p>


<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>This feature is installed as part of the standard DataPower installation process outlined in the <strong>Policy Manager for IBM WebSphere DataPower 7.0: Installation Guide</strong>.</p>
