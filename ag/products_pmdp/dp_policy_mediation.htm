<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Within a managed DataPower service, mediation refers to the ability to manage differences between a communication going into the DataPower appliance and communications, typically of a different type, going out of the DataPower appliance. For example, DataPower might receive a SOAP/HTTP communication into the front of the appliance, but send a SOAP/WebSphere MQ communication out of the back of the appliance, to a back-end system.</p>
<p>Going from SOAP/HTTP to SOAP/WebSphere MQ is an example of a mediation. DataPower adds some automatic mediation functionality for managed services, while Policy Manager for DataPower adds some mediation functionality of its own, while user-contributed logic can add still other mediation functionality. Between all three of DataPower, Policy Manager for DataPower, and user-contributed functionality, a wide range of mediations are possible within managed DataPower APIs.</p>
<p>The <strong>DataPower Mediation Policy</strong> allows you to enable Pass-Through and Advanced Mediation modes.</p>
