<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy Component</strong> allows you to reference one or more DataPower <strong>Processing Rules</strong> by allowing you to dynamically attach to the non-pipeline version of the policy by referencing the <strong>User-Defined Category</strong>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>First, using the <strong>Add Policy Wizard</strong>, add a Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy, define a User-Defined Category and add one or more DataPower Processing Rules.</li>
	<li>After this step is complete, add the Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy Component to your Pipeline Policy and enter the User-Defined Category specified in the non-pipeline version of the policy.</li>
	<li>Each policy must be attached to a service operation. The attachment sequence should be non-pipeline version first followed by the pipeline version.</li>
	<li>When the policy gets deployed with the service to DataPower, it matches the specified User-Defined Category to the correct Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy, searches for the name of each DataPower Processing Rule (Rule Name) in the DataPower domain and executes the rule based on the sequence specified in the policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the User-Defined DataPower Policy Component configuration process to get you started.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy (non-pipeline) version must be added using the Add Policy Wizard and defined and configured prior to this configuration as the User-Defined Category from this policy is referenced in the pipeline version of the policy. See <a href="dp_policy_dynam_userdefined_nonpipeline.htm"> Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy (Non-Pipeline)</a> for more information.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Add Policy / Use System Policy</h4>
<p>You can create a Pipeline Policy instance using <strong>Add Policy</strong> in the <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong> section.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Modify Policy</h4>
<p>When you <strong>Modify</strong> the Pipeline Policy, and use <strong>Add Component</strong> to add the Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy Component, the<strong> Modify Pipeline Policy</strong> will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/dynamic_user_defined_datapower_component.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This component can be used in the Request Configuration, Response Configuration, or Fault Configuration. You can position the component anywhere in the request, response, or fault.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Configure</h4>
<p>The process of configuring the Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy Component involves referencing a User-Defined Category that is defined in a non-pipeline version of the Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy. If you have not configured a Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy, see <a href="dp_policy_dynam_userdefined_nonpipeline.htm">Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy (Non-Pipeline)</a> for more information.</p>
<p>To configure the Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy Component, select the policy on the Modify Pipeline Policy screen and click <strong>Modify Component</strong>. The <strong>Modify Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy Component</strong> screen displays. Enter the category to reference in the <strong>User-Defined Category</strong> field display and commit your changes.</p>
<p>For example, if the category you defined in the Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy (non-pipeline) is SampleCategory:</p>
<p><img src="images/sample_category.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>You will enter SampleCategory in the User-Defined Category field on the Modify Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy Component screen.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Attach Policy</h4>
<p>After you have saved your policy you must attach <strong>both</strong> the Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy Component and the Dynamic User-Defined DataPower Policy that contains the User-Defined Category you referenced to specific web service or at the Organization level and the policy will be active for all services defined within the organization. The non-pipeline policy should be attached first as follows:</p>
