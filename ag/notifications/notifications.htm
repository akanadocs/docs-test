<h2 id="pm_notifications_alerts">Alert Notifications</h2>
<p>In Policy Manager, alerts are generated for certain events; installation includes a set of default alerts, and alerts can be added, customized, or deleted.</p>
<p>Users can define alert codes, the action that triggers the alert, and the actions that are taken when an alert code is generated. Actions can include sending emails, sending SNMP traps, or executing scripts.</p>
<p>An example of an alert notification email generated in Policy Manager is a user login failure due to incorrect credentials. </p>
<p>You can set up one or more email groups that various alerts are sent to, and you can manage the membership of the email groups as needed.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to <a href="../alerts/alerts_toc.htm">Policy Manager Alerts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cm_notifications_all">Community Manager developer portal Notifications</h2>
<p>The Community Manager developer portal sends out notifications for many types of events relating to apps, APIs, and groups as well as user-specific notifications such as a password reset link.</p>
<p>Users can configure whether email notifications are sent to them, for certain notification groups such as app posts, app lifecycle changes.</p>


<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>An example of an email notification from the Community Manager developer portal is shown below. In this example, the <strong>mail to</strong> element has been set to <strong>no-reply@open</strong>. This example communicates that customers should not reply. If you want customers to have the ability to respond to notifications, use a full and valid email address.</p>

<p><img src="images/cm_notification_example.jpg" alt="Sample Community Manager developer portal notification" /></p>
<h4>Where they are set up</h4>
<p>For Community Manager developer portal notifications, the <strong>mail to</strong> address is initially set in the optional <strong>fromEmailAddress</strong> element in the Jython script used to create the Community Manager developer portal tenant. See <a href="../..//sp/platform_install/install_cm_jython_script.htm#jython_script_elements">Jython Script Elements</a> (installation doc).</p>
<p>Once it's set up, the Site Admin can change it, if needed, in the Community Manager developer portal user interface: <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Site</strong>, in the <strong>From Email</strong> field. See <a href="../../cm/learnmore/site_admin_site.htm">How do I configure site settings?</a> (Community Manager developer portal Site Admin help).</p>

<h4>Notification configuration options for Community Manager developer portal users</h4>
<p>Community Manager developer portal users have configuration options available, so that they can control the types of notifications sent to them.</p>
