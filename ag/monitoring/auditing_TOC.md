## About Auditing Tools
Auditing tools are used for measuring the performance of a Policy Manager deployment. These tools can be found under the *Auditing* tab of the Policy Manager Management Console.

The Audit Trails sections of Policy Manager's *Auditing* tab allow you to monitor system activity based on either alert notifications or security policy-related actions, users, and date and time range. This system activity is saved in an "Audit Trail" which is a log of add, modify, and delete operations performed on all objects in the system. Selected "Audit Trail" records can be exported to an XML file and used for reporting purposes. This data can be used to measure system performance and manage the security of web services. Two types of audit trail functionality are offered:

## Alert Audit Trails
*Alert Audit Trails* provide the ability to filter, view, and export data that is logged when an alert is *raised*. To activate the alert audit feature, select the **Log Alert** checkbox in the *Alert Code Definition* table found under the *Alert Codes* tab of the *Alerts* section of the Policy Manager.
