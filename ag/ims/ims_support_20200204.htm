<h2>Known limitations</h2>
<p>Most aspects of Intermediary for Microsoft&nbsp;work exactly the same in version 2020.2.4 as in earlier published and documented versions. However, the items below are limitations in this version:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Akana Intermediary Support Service OAuth feature does not work correctly in version 2020.2.4. If you need this feature, use an earlier version of Intermediary for Microsoft.</li>
	<li>Intermediary for Microsoft does not currently support writing directly to a MongoDB database.</li>
	<li>If you are using an audit policy, such as the <a href="../policies/policy_op_ws_auditing_message.htm">WS-Auditing Message Policy</a> policy, do not include the <strong>Audit Transport Headers</strong>&nbsp;setting. This setting currently results in a Windows error.</li>
</ul>
