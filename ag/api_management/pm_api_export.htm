<h2 id="pm_api_export_overview">Exporting a service: Overview</h2>
<p>In Policy Manager, any service can be exported. The <strong>Export Service Wizard</strong> provides a method of exporting Policy Manager data to a Package file. You can then import the Package file into a different Policy Manager deployment using the <strong>Import Package</strong> function.</p>
<p>The <strong>Export Service</strong> function is available in the Service Details section of the Policy Manager Management Console (<strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong> &gt; <strong>Services</strong>) via the <strong>Actions</strong> portlet. In the <strong>Select Export Options</strong> section of the <strong>Export Service Wizard</strong>, you can specify the parts of the Service Information Model that you want to export. The options are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Operational Policies</li>
	<li>QoS Policies</li>
	<li>Compliance Policies</li>
	<li>Metadata Attachments</li>
	<li>PKI Keys and X.509 Certificates</li>
	<li>Processes</li>
	<li>Scripts</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the service information model is exported by default.</p>
