<ul>
	<li>Monitor system activity based on alert notifications or security policy-related actions, users, and date and time range. </li>
	<li>This system activity is saved in an Audit Trail, which is a log of add, modify, and delete operations performed on all objects in the system. </li>
	<li>Selected Audit Trail records can be exported to an XML file and used for reporting purposes. </li>
	<li>This data can be used to measure system performance and manage the security of web services. </li>
</ul>
