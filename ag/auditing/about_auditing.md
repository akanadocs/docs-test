## Introduction
The *Audit Trails* section of Policy Manager's *Auditing* tab allows you to:

* Monitor system activity based on alert notifications or security policy-related actions, users, and date and time range. 
* This system activity is saved in an "Audit Trail" which is a log of add, modify, and delete operations performed on all objects in the system. 
* Selected "Audit Trail" records can be exported to an XML file and used for reporting purposes. 
* This data can be used to measure system performance and manage the security of web services. 

## [Alert Audit Trails](../auditing/using_alert_auditing.html)
Alert Audit Trails provide the ability to filter, view, and export data that is logged when an alert is *raised*. 

## [Security Audit Trails](../auditing/using_security_auditing.html)
Security Audit Trails provide the ability to filter, view and export data that is logged when a security policy related action occurs during the operation of your Policy Manager deployment.
