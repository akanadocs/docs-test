### <a name="introduction"></a>Overview

This document describes how to build a simple policy handler using the Eclipse IDE.

#### <a name="data"></a>Prerequisites

* This configuration guide assumes that youâ€™ve already installed the platform. If you need help installing the platform, please see the [install guide](http://docs.akana.com/sp/assets/SOA_Software_Platform_Install_Guide_v70.pdf). 
* If writing policy components for the API Gateway, you will have to create and configure a Policy Manager (PM) and Network Directory (ND) container. This is described in the document [Managing a Simple API](simple-api.html#Installing)
* Install and configure the Eclipse IDE as described in the document [Eclipse Workspace Setup](eclipse-setup.html)

### <a name="project"></a>Create your plug-in project

1. Switch to the Plug-in Development perspective, click on **File**, choose **New**, and select **Plug-in Project**. 
2. Give the project a name such as 'com.soa.examples.policy.handler.simple'. In **Target Platform**, select the **OSGi framework**, and choose **standard** in the drop-down. Click **Next >**.
3. Provide or remove the qualifier in the **version** field and select the 'JavaSE-1.7' **Execution Environment**. Unselect **Generate an Activator**. Click **Next >**.
4. Unselect **Create a plug-in using one of the templates**. Click **Finish**.

### <a name="build"></a>Building the simple policy handler example

The platform ships with a number of samples that can be found in the '/samples' subdirectory. Included in these is a simple policy handler, which we will import into the plug-in project, compile and build.

1. Drag and drop the contents of the '/samples/com.soa.examples.policy.handler.simple' directory into the root of the 'com.soa.examples.policy.handler.simple' plug-in project created in the previous section. Since the directory already contains a MANIFEST.MF file, the values entered into #3 of the previous section will be overwritten.
2. Build the project from top **Project ** menu and verify that there are no compilation errors.
3. Open the Ant view and drag the build/build.xml file into it. Double-click on the 'simple-policy-handler-example' project to run the build script.
4. If the build is successful, the resulting JAR file can be found in a '/build/bin/' sub-directory in your Eclipse workspace root directory.
