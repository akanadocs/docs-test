<h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p>The Paging Policy is designed to allow a client to only get a subset of a list based response. For example, if an operation is returning a list of books, and the full list is 1000 books, the client may wish to only have 100 books be returned at a time.</p>
<p>The policy applies to both SOAP and RESTful (XML) services. When the policy is attached to an operation the client can request subsets of the list. The document structure around the list is returned with every response, but only a subset of the books themselves in this example.</p>

<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>The client requests the subset of items by providing two  query parameters named &quot;index&quot; and &quot;count&quot; in the RESTful case. </li>
  <li>For SOAP messages two SOAP headers are provided, {http://federatedgovernance.org/policy/paging}Index and {http://federatedgovernance.org/policy/paging}Count. </li>
  <li>The index parameter/header is the row number of the full list that should be returned as the first item to the current request. </li>
  <li>The count parameter/header is how many rows should be returned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Determining what is a row of the response is specified in the Paging Policy. An XPath expression is used to identify what a row is in the XML document. The XPath expression will be evaluated against the full response which should result in a list of elements. The list of elements returned by the XPath expression are filtered by the index and count properties as described above.</p>

<h5>Configuration Options</h5>
<p>The policy includes the following configuration options:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li><strong>Item XPath</strong> - Used for  entering an XPath expression.</li>
  <li><strong>Namespace Prefixes Table</strong> â€“ Holds list of namespace prefix definitions used in the XPath expression in the specified Item XPath. Includes columns for specifying Prefix used in the XPath, and Namespace associated with the Prefix. </li>
  <li><strong>Add</strong> - Adds an empty row to the Namespace Prefixes table. </li>
  <li><strong>Remove</strong> - Remove the selected row from the  Namespace Prefixes table.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuration</h3></a>



<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the Paging   Policy configuration process to get your started.
</p>
<h5>Step 1: Add Policy</h5>

  <p>You can create a Paging Policy  instance using <strong>Add Policy</strong> in the <em>Policies &gt; Operational Policies</em> section.</p>
  <h5>Step 2: Modify Policy</h5>
<p>When you <strong>Modify</strong> the Paging Policy  policy on the <em>Policy Details</em> page the initial policy will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/paging policy.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="319"></p>
<p>Add the desired XPath and Namespace information (e.g., //*[local-name()='result']):</p>
<p><img src="images/paging_policy_summary.jpg" width="528" height="204"></p>
<h5>Step 3: Create Physical Service and Virtualize</h5>

<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Create a physical service.</li>
  <li>Virtualize and host it on Network Director (Example service name: <strong>Vs1</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Step 4: Attach Policies</h5>

<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Attach <strong>Detailed Auditing</strong> and <strong>Paging</strong> policies to <strong>Vs1</strong> service.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/attach policy_paging.jpg" width="517" height="279">  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Step 5: Configure Paging Policy</h5>

<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Create a project in SOAP UI and  send requests to the virtual service.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>SOAP Request Message:</strong><br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <strong>SOAP Response Message:</strong><br>

  </li>
