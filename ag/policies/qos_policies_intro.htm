<h2 name="top">About QoS Policies</h2>



<p>Policy  Manager includes a series of Quota Management Policies you can use to protect your  web services from intentional or unintentional overuse. The Quota Management  Policy solution:</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Allows  API providers to specify maximum quotas for each contracted user of their  service.</li>
  <li>Allows  quotas to be specified as transactions per second values.</li>
  <li>Allows  quotas to be specified as transactions per day, per week, and per month as well  as per second.</li>
  <li>Enforces  quotas for each contract, denying any transactions over and above the quota in  the specified period (i.e., if the quota is 50tps, once 50 transactions have  been processed within the last second, any more transaction requests within the  last second will be denied with an HTTP 403 for RESTful services , or an  appropriate SOAP Fault.</li>
  <li>Allows  you to specify performance optimization policies that define actions the system  will take in the event of particular conditions (e.g., reduce all quotas for  all consumers to &quot;emergency&quot; levels when a particular SLA threshold  is reached).</li>
</ul>
