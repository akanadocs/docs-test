<h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p>The &quot;Service Level Policy&quot; defines conditions for measuring and reporting performance of a specific Contract. Each policy is composed of a &quot;Rule&quot; and &quot;Access Interval.&quot; Rules represent the conditions you define to measure and report performance of a service contract. When a defined system condition matches a defined rule, an alert is raised. A &quot;Rule&quot; is composed of &quot;Rule Elements&quot; (i.e., Alert Code, Metric, Operator, Value, Units, and Interval) that are configured to meet your service monitoring requirements.

</p>
<h3><a name="options" id="options">Service Level Policy Options</a></h3>
<p>An &quot;Access Interval&quot; is composed of one or more &quot;Access Days&quot; (Sunday through Saturday). Each &quot;Access Day&quot; is configured with an &quot;Access Time&quot; that can represent one complete day (All Day) or a date range (Range) that is specified using a 24-hour clock format (HH:MM). See QoS Policy Functionality Overview for more information.</p>
<p>When you add an Service Level Policy Rule, you define the service measurement and reporting configuration that will be referenced by services and contracts. The attributes you will define include:</p>
<h5>Service Level Policy Name and Description</h5>
<p>The name and description you assign to the Service Level Policy.</p>
<h5>Service Level Policy Rules</h5>
<p>Rules represent the conditions you define to measure and report performance for that specific service that is referencing or contains the configuration of a Service Level Policy. When a defined system condition matches a defined rule, an alert is raised in the Policy Manager. </p>
<p>Note: Available SLA Custom Alert Codes are selectable from the drop-down list box  on the Alert Code field. You can also enter a new SLA Custom Alert Code directly  into the Service Level Policy Rule line item. The minimum SLA Alert Code start number  is 700000. Refer to See <em>About Alert Codes</em> in the Policy Manager Online Help (accessible via the Policy Manager Management Console) for more information  on adding a new alert code in <em>Alerts &gt; Alert Codes</em> section of the Management Console.</p>
<p>A rule is composed of the following elements:</p>

<h5>Example Rule Definition</strong></h5>
<p>Send alert code [30002] when the [Maximum Response Time] for Service Operation is<br />
  [&gt;] [5] [Seconds] in a [1 hour] time interval.</p>
<p>Before you begin creating rules, you should review the list of available alert codes  to determine which codes you wish to use. One common approach is to establish a series  of two or three thresholds, each using the same metric. The first threshold indicates  that there may be a problem with a service monitored by the Service Level Policy,  the second indicates that there is a problem, but it may not be a serious one, and the third is a warning that there is a major problem that needs to be addressed immediately.</p>

<h5>Service Level Policy Access Time</h5>
<p>Access Time is configured by defining an &quot;Access Interval.&quot; An &quot;Access Interval&quot;  is composed of one or more &quot;Access Days&quot; (Sunday through Saturday). Each &quot;Access  Day&quot; is configured with an &quot;Access Time&quot; that can represent one complete day (All Day) or a date range (Range) that is specified using a 24-hour clock format (HH:MM).</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3></a>
<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the Service Level  Policy configuration process to get your started.

</p>
<h5>Step 1: Add Policy</h5>
<p>In Policy Manager, you can create a Service Level  Policy instance using <strong>Add Policy</strong> in the <em>Policies &gt; QoS Policies</em> section. </p>
<h5>Step 2: Modify Policy</h5>
<p>When you <strong>Modify</strong> the Service Level Policy on the <em>Policy Details</em> page the initial policy will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/modify service level policy rules.jpg" width="614" height="431" /></p>
<p>Configure the policy options based on your requirements and <strong>Apply</strong>. Refer to the <a href="#options">Service Level Policy Options</a> section for a functional overview of each
rule element.</p>
<h5>Step 3: Attach Policy</h5>
<p>After you have saved your policy you can  attach it to a web service,  operation, or binding.</p>
<h5>Step 4: Test Policy and View Monitoring Data</h5>
<p>After you attached the Service Level  Policy to a service, operation, or binding, send a request to your service and go to the <em>Services &gt; Monitoring</em> section to view the results for Logs, Real Time Charts, and Historical Charts. Refer to the Policy Manager Online Help (i.e., Help button) for more information on the using the monitoring functions.</p>
