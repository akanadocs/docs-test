<a name="introduction"></a><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Service Level Policy defines conditions for measuring and reporting performance of a specific contract. Each policy is composed of a <strong>Rule</strong> and an <strong>Access Interval</strong>. Rules represent the conditions you define to measure and report performance of a service contract. When a defined system condition matches a defined rule, an alert is raised. A <strong>Rule</strong> is composed of <strong>Rule Elements</strong> (Alert Code, Metric, Operator, Value, Units, and Interval) that you can configure to meet your service monitoring requirements.</p>



<a name="options" id="options"></a><h3>Service Level Policy Options</h3>
<p>An <strong>Access Interval</strong> is composed of one or more <strong>Access Days</strong> (Sunday through Saturday). Each <strong>Access Day</strong> is configured with an <strong>Access Time</strong> that can represent one complete day (All Day) or a date range (Range) that is specified using a 24-hour clock format (HH:MM). For more information, see <a href="qos_policies_intro.htm">About QoS Policies</a>.</p>
<p>When you add a Service Level Policy Rule, you define the service measurement and reporting configuration that will be referenced by services and contracts. The attributes you will define are listed below.</p>
<h5>Service Level Policy Name and Description</h5>
<p>The name and description you assign to the Service Level Policy.</p>
<h5>Service Level Policy Rules</h5>
<p>Rules represent the conditions you define to measure and report performance for the specific service that is referencing or contains the configuration of a Service Level Policy. When a defined system condition matches a defined rule, an alert is raised in Policy Manager.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can select from available SLA Custom Alert Codes in the drop-down list box on the Alert Code field. You can also enter a new SLA Custom Alert Code directly into the Service Level Policy Rule line item. The minimum SLA Alert Code start number is 700000. For more information on adding a new alert code in the <em>Alerts &gt; Alert Codes</em> section of the Management Console, refer to <strong>About Alert Codes</strong> in the Policy Manager Online Help (accessible via the Policy Manager Management Console).</p>
<p>A rule is composed of the elements shown below.</p>

<h5>Example Rule Definition</h5>
<p>Send alert code [30002] when the [Maximum Response Time] for Service Operation is:</p>
<p>[&gt;] [5] [Seconds] in a [1 hour] time interval.</p>
<p>Before you begin creating rules, review the list of available alert codes to determine which codes you want to use. One common approach is to establish a series of two or three thresholds, each using the same metric:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first threshold indicates that there might be a problem with a service monitored by the Service Level Policy.</li>
  <li>The second indicates that there is a problem, but it might not be a serious one.</li>
  <li>The third is a warning that there is a major problem that needs to be addressed immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Service Level Policy Access Time</h5>
<p>Access Time is configured by defining an <strong>Access Interval</strong>. An <strong>Access Interval</strong> is composed of one or more <strong>Access Days</strong> (Sunday through Saturday). Each <strong>Access Day</strong> is configured with an <strong>Access Time</strong> that can represent one complete day (All Day) or a date range (Range) that is specified using a 24-hour clock format (HH:MM).</p>
<table width="700
" cellspacing="0px" class="doctable">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th width="188">Access Time Option</th>
    <th width="471">Description</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr class="t2row">
    <td>Access Day</td>
    <td><p>Checkbox options that allow you to select the days you would like to include in the Access Interval. Selectable days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="t1row">
    <td>Access Time</td>
    <td>A drop-down list box option that allows you to select <strong>All Day</strong> or <strong>Range</strong> for each <strong>Access Day</strong> defined in the <strong>Access Interval</strong>. <strong>All Day</strong> represents a full 24-hour day. <strong>Range</strong> allows you to select <strong>To</strong> and <strong>From</strong> times using a 24-hour clock format (HH:MM).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="t2row">
    <td>From Time (Hours:Minutes)</td>
    <td><strong>Hour</strong> and <strong>Minute</strong> drop-down list boxes that allow you to select the <strong>From Time</strong> range to apply to the <strong>Access Time</strong> selection for the <strong>Access Interval</strong> definition. Hour increments are based on a 24-Hour.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="t1row">
    <td>To Time (Hours:Minutes)</td>
    <td><p><strong>Hour</strong> and <strong>Minute</strong> drop-down list boxes that allow you to select the <strong>To Time</strong> range to apply to the <strong>Access Time</strong> selection for the <strong>Access Interval</strong> definition. Hour increments are based on a 24-hour period.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="t2row">

</a><h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the Service Level Policy configuration process to get you started.

</p>
<h5>Step 1: Add Policy</h5>
<p>In Policy Manager, to create   a Service Level Policy instance, go to <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong> and choose <strong>Add Policy</strong>.</p>
<h5>Step 2: Modify Policy</h5>
<p>When you click <strong>Modify</strong> to make changes to the Service Level Policy on the <strong>Policy Details</strong> page, the initial policy looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/modify service level policy rules.jpg" width="608" height="406" alt="" /></p>
<p>Configure the policy options based on your requirements and click <strong>Apply</strong>. For a functional overview of each rule element, refer to the <a href="#options">Service Level Policy Options</a> section.</p>
<h5>Step 3: Attach Policy</h5>
<p>After you've saved your policy, you can attach it  to a web service, operation, or binding.</p>
<h5>Step 4: Test Policy and View Monitoring Data</h5>
<p>After you've attached the Service Level Policy to a web service, operation, or binding, send a request to your service and go to the <em>Services &gt; Monitoring</em> section to view the results for Logs, Real Time Charts, and Historical Charts. For more information on using the monitoring functions, refer to the Policy Manager Online Help, available via the Help button.</p>
