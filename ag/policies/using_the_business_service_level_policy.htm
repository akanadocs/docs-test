<a name="introduction"></a><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The &quot;Business Service Level Policy&quot; is a QoS policy is used to calculate service performance levels based on metrics in an Envision data set.</p>
<ul>
<li>A policy is defined by selecting a dataset, dimension filters, and defining policy &quot;Rules&quot; and &quot;Access Intervals.&quot;</li>
<li>The policy is uses data collected by a Business Metrics Policy. </li>
<li>This policy works in conjunction with the Akana Envision product. </li>
</ul>

<a name="business_service_level_policy_options"></a><h3>Business Service Level Policy Options</h3>
<p>When you add a Business Service Level Policy you configure the service measurement and reporting configuration that will be referenced by services. The attributes you will configure include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Service Level Policy Name and Description</li>
<li>Data set</li>
<li>Dimension Filter</li>
<li>Business Service Level Policy Rules</li>
<li>Business Service Level Policy Access Intervals</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<a name="config_options"></a><h3>Configuration Options</h3>
<h4>Policy Name and Description</h4>
<p>The name and description you assign to the Business Service Level Policy.</p>
<h4>Select Data Set</h4>
<ul>
<li>Used to select a data set that consists of Metrics and Dimensions the policy can report statistics for. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Select Dimensions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to define service level performance rules by configuring filters for Dimensions of the selected data set.</li>
<li>For example, if you have a Shoe Sales data set and would like to capture service level performance on a specific &quot;merchant&quot; you would select the &quot;Merchant&quot; dimension, and specify the merchant name as the &quot;filter.&quot;</li>
<li>You can specify multiple Filters by separating each entry with a comma.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you select a dimension, you must specify a value or values in the <strong>Filter</strong> field. Leaving the <strong>Filter</strong> field empty prevents data records from being selected.</p>

<h4>Modify Business Service Level Rules</h4>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to define conditions to measure service level performance. When a Policy Manager system condition matches a defined rule, an alert is raised.</li>
</ul>
<p>A &quot;Rule&quot; is composed of &quot;Rule Elements&quot; (i.e., Alert Code, Metric, Operator, Value, Aggregation, and Interval) that are configured to meet your service monitoring requirements. The list of available Metrics is based on the selected data set. At least one rule must be defined per policy.</p>
<p>A rule is composed of the following elements:</p>
<table cellspacing="0px" class="doctable" style="width: 98%;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="25%">Rule Element</th>
      <th width="75%">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="t2row">
      <td>Alert Code</td>
      <td>An identification number that represents the alert you would like to send when the defined condition is met. This value is manually entered into a text box.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="t1row">
      <td>Metric</td>
      <td>A measurable function (such as a Response Time) that is used in the rule calculation. <strong>Note</strong>: <em>The &quot;Total&quot; metric options add up the combined size of all the message payload over the time period.</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="t2row">
      <td>Operator</td>
      <td>A symbol that represents a mathematical function (&lt;=, &gt;=, etc.) used to limit or expand your search to qualify the metric.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="t1row">
      <td>Value</td>
      <td>A numerical value that establishes the threshold of the metric. This value is manually entered into a text box.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="t2row">
      <td>Aggregation</td>
      <td>A Unit is the unit measure by which the value is counted.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="t1row">
      <td>Interval</td>
      <td>Time interval over which the rule is measured.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<h4>Modify Business Service Level Policy Access Time</h4>
<p>Allows you to define one or more &quot;Access Days&quot; (Sunday through Saturday). Each &quot;Access Day&quot; is configured with an &quot;Access Time&quot; that can represent one complete day (All Day) or a date range (Range) that is specified using a 24-hour clock format (HH:MM).</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Available SLA Custom Alert Codes are selectable from the drop-down list box on the Alert Code field.</em></li>
<li><em>You can also enter a new SLA Custom Alert Code directly into the Service Level Policy Rule line item.</em></li>
<li><em>Refer to <a href="http://docs.akana.com/ag/alerts/using_alert_codes.html">Alert Codes</a> for more information on adding a new alert code.</em></li>
</ul>
