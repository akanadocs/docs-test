<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>An Aggregate Policy is a collection of policies that are gathered together to form a policy group. Policies included in an Aggregate policy are defined to achieve a specific purpose relative to governing Policy Manager objects (Organizations, Services, and so on).</p>
<p>Some examples of scenarios where you might want to define an Aggregate Policy:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Basic Authentication: requires the HTTP Security policy and an Authentication policy.</li>
	<li>Client Certificate: requires the HTTP Security policy and an Authentication policy.</li>
	<li>A use case such as <a href="http://docs.akana.com/ag/ca_siteminder/ca_siteminder_use_case_binary_security_token.htm">Using Binary Security Token with WS-Security Policy</a>, where you're using an Authentication policy and a WS-Security Transport Binding policy.</li>
	<li>Any scenario where you're using a WS-Security policy: requires an Authentication policy as well as the WS-Security policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="aggregate_create">Creating an Aggregate Policy</h3>
<p>The first step in creating a policy is to define the basic policy information. Then, you can configure the policy details.</p>

<h5>To add an operational policy</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong>, and select <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong>. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add Policy</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose the policy type and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li>Specify a name (required) and description (optional) and click <strong>Finish</strong>. At the <strong>Completion Summary</strong>, Click <strong>Close</strong>. The <strong>Add Policy</strong> Wizard creates a draft policy instance that you can then configure on the <strong>Policy Details</strong> page.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see <a href="policy_management.htm#add_policy">Add Policy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<h3 id="aggregate_config">Configuring an Aggregate Policy</h3>
<p>An Aggregate Policy is a containment policy that allows you to create a logical grouping of Policy Manager policies. Essentially, you first create the aggregate policy, and then you add and configure each policy that you want to include in the aggregate policy.</p>

<h5>Component Functionality</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Each policy must be configured as a separate entity.</li>
	<li>Policies can be directly added to an Aggregate policy, and exist inside the logical grouping.</li>
	<li>You can reference policies that have already been defined, from within the aggregate policy. In this scenario, the policies still display in their original location within Policy Manager but also display as part of the Aggregate policy.</li>
	<li>An Aggregate policy can include both newly defined and existing (referenced) policies.</li>
	<li>If you change a policy that's referenced by one or more Aggregate policies, the change applies to all instances of the policy; the original instance and every occurrence within an Aggregate policy.</li>
	<li>You can attach the Aggregate Policy to objects such as services in the same way that you'd attach any other policy.</li>
</ul>

<h5>To define new policies in an Aggregate policy</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong> and select the <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong> folder. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Find the policy on the list and click to go to the <strong>Details</strong> page for the policy.</li>
	<li>In the second panel, in the <strong>Policies</strong> section, click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first new policy.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Select Policy Creation Option</strong> page, choose the policy type that you're adding and then <strong>click</strong> Next.</li>
	<li>Specify the policy name and then click <strong>Finish</strong>, then click <strong>Close</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the <strong>Details</strong> page for the policy you just added, click <strong>Modify</strong>. Configure the policy details as you normally would. The configuration options are different for each policy. For a full list of policies, with links to policy documentation details, see <a href="about_policies_view.htm">About Policies</a>.</li>
	<li>In the left pane, click the Aggregate Policy. In the center pane, click <strong>Add</strong> to add a second policy. Repeat steps 4 through 7 as needed to add all the policies you need in your Aggregate policy.</li>
</ol>

<h5>To reference existing policies in an Aggregate policy</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong> and select the <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong> folder. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Find the policy on the list and click to go to the <strong>Details</strong> page for the policy.</li>
	<li>In the second panel, in the Policy References section, click <strong>Modify</strong> to reference the first existing policy.</li>
	<li>In the Organization Tree that opens, check the boxes for one or more existing policies, and click Apply. The policies are added to the Aggregate Policy.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="policy_attach">Attaching the Policy</h3>
<p>To use the Aggregate Policy, go to the <strong>Policies</strong> folder in the Root Organization and attach the policy to a web service, binding, or binding operation.</p>
