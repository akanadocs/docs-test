<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>An Aggregate Policy is a collection of policies that are gathered together to form a policy group. Policies included in an Aggregate policy are defined to achieve a specific purpose relative to governing Policy Manager objects (Organizations, Services, and so on). You can specify that messages must meet <strong>all</strong> the policies defined (Policy Enforcement Requirement of <strong>AND</strong>), or must meet at least one of them (Policy Enforcement Requirement of <strong>OR</strong>).</p>
<p>Some examples of scenarios where you might want to define an Aggregate Policy:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Basic Authentication: requires the HTTP Security policy and an Authentication policy.</li>
	<li>Client Certificate: requires the HTTP Security policy and an Authentication policy.</li>
	<li>A use case such as <a href="../ca_siteminder/ca_siteminder_implement_use_cases.htm#ca_sm_uc_binary_security_token">Using Binary Security Token with WS-Security Policy</a>, where you're using an Authentication policy and a WS-Security Transport Binding policy.</li>
	<li>Any scenario where you're using a WS-Security policy: requires an Authentication policy as well as the WS-Security policy.</li>
	<li>You could use this policy, with OR configured, in a scenario where there are different consumers that want to consume an API in different ways. For example, some consumers might want to use OAuth and some might want to use Basic Auth. You could configure an Aggregate Policy so that an API could support both. To do this, include both policies in the aggregate and set the Policy Enforcement Requirement to OR. See <a href="#proc_aggregate_policy_config">To configure policy enforcement requirements</a> below.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="aggregate_create">Creating an Aggregate Policy</h2>
<p>The first step in creating a policy is to define the basic policy information.</p>

<h4>To add an operational policy</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong>, and select <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong>. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add Policy</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose the policy type and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li>Specify a name (required) and description (optional) and click <strong>Finish</strong>. At the <strong>Completion Summary</strong>, click <strong>Close</strong>. The <strong>Add Policy</strong> Wizard creates a draft policy instance that you can then configure on the <strong>Policy Details</strong> page.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see <a href="policy_management.htm#add_policy">Add Policy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="aggregate_config">Configuring an Aggregate Policy</h2>
<p>An Aggregate Policy is a containment policy that allows you to create a logical grouping of Policy Manager policies. Essentially, you first create the aggregate policy, and then you add and configure each policy that you want to include in the aggregate policy.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Each policy must be configured as a separate entity.</li>
	<li>Policies can be directly added to an Aggregate policy, and exist inside the logical grouping.</li>
	<li>You can reference policies that have already been defined, from within the Aggregate policy. In this scenario, the policies still display in their original location within Policy Manager but also display as part of the Aggregate policy.</li>
	<li>An Aggregate policy can include both newly defined and existing (referenced) policies.</li>
	<li>If you change a policy that's referenced by one or more Aggregate policies, the change applies to all instances of the policy&#8212;the original instance and every occurrence within an Aggregate policy.</li>
	<li>You can attach the Aggregate Policy to objects such as services in the same way that you'd attach any other policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Configure policy enforcement requirements (<strong>Valid in version: 2019.0.0 and later</strong>): this allows you to configure policy alternates depending on circumstances. You can configure <strong>AND</strong> or <strong>OR</strong>. See <a href="#proc_aggregate_policy_config">To configure policy enforcement requirements</a> below.</li>
	<li>Add policies, either by defining new policies or referencing existing policies. Refer to these procedures:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#proc_aggregate_policy_new">To define new policies in an Aggregate policy</a></li>
			<li><a href="#proc_aggregate_policy_existing">To reference existing policies in an Aggregate policy</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="proc_aggregate_policy_config">To configure policy enforcement requirements</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong> and select the <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong> folder. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Find the policy on the list and click to go to the <strong>Details</strong> page for the policy.</li>
	<li>In the first panel, in the <strong>Options</strong> section, click <strong>Modify</strong>.
		<p>The <strong>Choose Policy Enforcement Requirement</strong> page is displayed. An example is shown below.</p>
		<p><img src="images/aggregate_policy_01.jpg" alt="Aggregate Policy: configuring policy enforcement requirements" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>In the Options field, specify your preference:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>AND</strong>: The message must meet the requirements of all policies or it will fail. This is the default behavior. All the policies configured in the aggregate must be satisfied.</li>
			<li><strong>OR</strong>: If the message meets the requirements of any one of the policies configured in the aggregate, it is successful.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="proc_aggregate_policy_new">To define new policies in an Aggregate policy</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong> and select the <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong> folder. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Find the policy on the list and click to go to the <strong>Details</strong> page for the policy.</li>
	<li>In the second panel, in the <strong>Policies</strong> section, click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first new policy.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Select Policy Creation Option</strong> page, choose the policy type that you're adding and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li>Specify the policy name and then click <strong>Finish</strong>, then click <strong>Close</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the <strong>Details</strong> page for the policy you just added, click <strong>Modify</strong>. Configure the policy details as you normally would. The configuration options are different for each policy. For a full list of policies, with links to policy documentation details, see <a href="about_policies_view.htm">About Policies</a>.</li>
	<li>In the left pane, click the Aggregate Policy. In the center pane, click <strong>Add</strong> to add a second policy. Repeat steps 4 through 7 as needed to add all the policies you need in your Aggregate policy.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="proc_aggregate_policy_existing">To reference existing policies in an Aggregate policy</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong> and select the <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong> folder. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Find the policy on the list and click to go to the <strong>Details</strong> page for the policy.</li>
	<li>In the second panel, in the Policy References section, click <strong>Modify</strong> to reference the first existing policy.</li>
	<li>In the Organization Tree that opens, check the boxes for one or more existing policies, and then click <strong>Apply</strong>. The policies are added to the Aggregate Policy.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="policy_activating">Activating a policy</h2>
<p>When you create and configure a policy, the policy is in <strong>Draft</strong> state. When the policy configuration is complete, activate the policy: click <strong>Activate Policy</strong> and then confirm. See <a href="policy_management.htm#policy_activate">Activate a Policy</a>.</p>
<p>A policy in Draft state is not available for general use. Once you activate the policy, it is in <strong>Active</strong> state and is available for use.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="policy_attach">Attaching a policy</h2>
<p>To use the Aggregate Policy, go to the <strong>Policies</strong> folder in the respective organization and attach the policy to a web service, binding, or binding operation.</p>
