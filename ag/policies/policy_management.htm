<h3>Policy Management Functions</h3>
<p>The following policy management functions apply to policy definitions in the Policies folder. They are available on the <em>Policy Summary</em> drop-down menu or via the Actions Portlet on the <em>Policies &gt; Details</em> page.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<a name="add_policy"></a><h3>Add Policy</h3>
<p>Used to define policies that are used to manage web service endpoints. Notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A policy is initialized with a default configuration. You can then customize the policy to address the unique requirements of your web service management system.</li>
	<li>When you've configured the policy, you'll need to activate it via the <em>Policy Workflow Portlet</em> before it is visible and available for attachment in the hierarchy tree of the <em>Policy Attachments Portlet</em>.</li>
	<li>After you've activated the policy, you can then &quot;attach&quot; it to objects it will be managing, including Organizations, Services, Operations, Bindings, and Access Points.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add a policy:</p>
<p>On the main <em>Policies Summary</em> page, select <strong>Add Policy</strong>, select a policy type, and assign a name and description. The <strong>Add Policy</strong> Wizard creates a policy instance that you can modify on the <em>Policy Details</em> page.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<a name="attach_policy"></a><h3>Attach Policy</h3>
<p>Policies defined in the policies object (the Policies Folder) can be assigned to an organization, and to six different elements of a service. Each policy assignment is based on the business requirements defined for policies supported in each policy category (Compliance, Operational, and QoS) in addition to custom defined policies. Notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li> When a policy is assigned at the &quot;Service Details&quot; level, the policy is referenced in all other elements of the service (operations, bindings, access points).</li>
	<li> When a policy is referenced in a &quot;Policy Attachments Portlet,&quot; it is preceded with &quot;(from &lt;object name&gt;).&quot;</li>
	<li> Once a policy is referenced, it can only be removed at the source attachment point (in the Policy Attachments Portlet of the service).</li>
	<li>You can add additional policies to each service element using the &quot;Policy Attachments Portlet&quot; in each Management Console section.</li>
</ul>
<p>To attach a policy:</p>
<p>Go to the <em>Policy Attachments</em> portlet on the <em>Policy Details</em> page where you would like to attach a policy, and select <strong>Manage</strong>. Select a policy from the tree and save the configuration.</p>

<a name="modify_policy_information"></a><h3>Modify Policy Information</h3>
<p>Allows you to change the name and description of a policy.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<a name="change_organization_policy"></a><h3>Change Organization</h3>
<p>Allows you to move the current policy configuration to a new Organization.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Note that you can only move referenced policies (policies that are attached to an object) within the current Policy Scope (for example, Organization, Service, or Operation).</li>
	<li>If you want to move a policy to a different Organization, the references must stay in scope.</li>
	<li>To determine what references a policy might have, go to the current policy and then select <strong>View Policy References</strong>.</li>
	<li>To remove policy references, unattach the policy via the Policy Attachments Portlet.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<a name="copy_policy"></a><h3>Copy Policy</h3>
<p>Allows you to replicate a policy definition and assign a new <strong>Policy Name</strong> and <strong>Policy Key</strong>. Using this function you can configure elements that represent core functionality of a policy, replicate them to a new policy, and then perform additional customization on the copy.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<a name="delete_policy"></a><h3>Delete Policy</h3>
<p>Deletes the selected policy definition. In order to delete a policy, it cannot be &quot;Referenced&quot; (attached to one or more objects). The number of policy references is indicated on the <em>Policies Summary</em> page, in the &quot;#&quot; column. To view policies, select <strong>View Policy References</strong>.</p>
<p>If you would like to delete a policy, you must remove the policy attachment via Policy Attachments Portlet.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<a name="export_policy"></a><h3>Export Policy</h3>
<p>Provides a method of exporting a policy definition to a "Package" file. This "Package" file can then be imported into a different Policy Manager deployment using the "Import Package" function.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<a name="view_policy_references"></a><h3>View Policy References</h3>
<p>Displays a list of objects that the current policy is referencing.</p>
