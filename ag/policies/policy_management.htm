<p><a href="#top">back to top</a>
</p>

<a name="add_policy">
<h3>Add Policy</h3>
</a>

<p>Used to add policy definitions that are used to manage  web service endpoints. </p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>A policy is initialized with a default configuration which  you can customize to address the unique requirements of your web service management  system.</li>
  <li>After a policy is configured, you then &quot;attach&quot; it to objects it will be  managing including Organizations, Services, Operations, Bindings, and Access Points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Select <strong>Add Policy</strong> on the main <em>Policies Summary</em> page,  select a policy type, and assign a name and description. The Add Policy Wizard creates a policy instance that you can modify on the <em>Policy Details</em> page. </p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a>
</p>


<a name="attach_policy">
<h3>Attach Policy</h3>
</a>


<p>Policies defined in the policies object (i.e., Policies Folder) can be assigned to  an organization, and to six different elements of a service. Each Policy assignment  is based on the business requirements defined for policies supported in each policy  category (i.e., Compliance, Operational, QoS) in addition to custom defined policies.</p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li> When a policy is assigned  at the &quot;Service Details&quot; level, the policy is &quot;referenced&quot; in all other elements  of the service (i.e, operations, bindings, access points).</li>
  <li> When a policy is referenced  in a &quot;Policy Attachments Portlet&quot; it is preceded with &quot;(from &lt;object name&gt;).&quot;</li>
  <li> Referenced  policies can only be removed at the source attachment point (i.e., in the Policy  Attachments Portlet of the &quot;service&quot;).</li>
  <li>Additional policies can be added to each service  element using the &quot;Policy Attachments Portlet&quot; in each Management Console section.</li>
</ul>

<p>Go to the<em> Policy Attachments</em> portlet on the <em>Policy Details</em> page where you would like to attach a policy and select <strong>Manage</strong>. Select a policy from the tree and save the configuration. </p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a>

<a name="modify_policy_information">
<h3>Modify Policy Information</h3>
</a>

<p>Allows you to change the name and description of a policy. </p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a>
</p>

<a name="change_organization_policy"><h3>Change Organization</h3></a>

<p>Allows you to move the current policy configuration to a new "Organization."
 </p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>Note that referenced policies (i.e., those that are attached to an object)  can only be moved within the current Policy  Scope (i.e., Organization, Service, Operation, etc.).</li>
  <li>If you wish to move a policy  to a different "Organization" the references must stay in scope.</li>
  <li>To determine what references a policy  might have, select "View Policy References" for the current policy. </li>
  <li>To remove policy  references, unattach the policy via the Policy Attachments Portlet.  </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a>
</p>


<a name="copy_policy"><h3>Copy Policy</h3></a>

<p>Allows you to replicate a policy definition and assign a new "Policy Name" and "Policy Key." Using this function you can configure elements that represent core functionality of a policy, replicate them to a new policy, and then perform additional customization on the copy.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a>
</p>


<a name="delete_policy"><h3>Delete Policy</h3></a>

<p>Deletes the selected policy definition. In order to delete a policy, it cannot be &quot;Referenced&quot; (i.e., attached to one or more objects). The number of policy references are indicated in the &quot;#&quot; column on the <em>Policies Summary</em> page and can be viewed by selecting the &quot;View Policy References.&quot; </p>
<p>If you would like to delete a policy, you must remove the policy attachment via Policy Attachments Portlet. </p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a>
</p>


<a name="export_policy"><h3>Export Policy</h3></a>

<p>Provides a method of exporting a policy definition to a "Package" file. This "Package" file can then be imported into a different Policy Manager deployment using the "Import Package" function. </p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a>
</p>
<a name="view_policy_references"><h3>View Policy References</h3></a>

<p>Displays a list of objects that the current policy is referencing. </p>
