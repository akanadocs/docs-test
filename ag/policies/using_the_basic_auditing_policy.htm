<a name="introduction"></a><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Basic Auditing Policy is an out-of-the-box policy that is part of the Policy Manager default installation. It is an instance of the <em>Auditing Service Policy</em>; it provides basic auditing of messages and records the message metrics in the <em>Monitoring &gt; Logs</em> tab. The policy is located in the <em>Policies</em> folder of the root Organization. 
</p>
<p>The following message metrics are recorded, but the policy does not audit the messages themselves. If you need full message auditing, use the <em>Detailed Auditing</em> policy.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Message Size</strong>: Audits the size of messages in the exchange.</li>
  <li><strong>Binding</strong>: Audits binding information.</li>
  <li><strong>Contract</strong>: Audits the contract governing a message.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following identities are audited:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer</strong>: Audits consumer identity sent with a request message.</li>
  <li><strong>End User</strong>: Audits end-user identity sent with a request message.</li>
</ul>

</a><h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the Basic Auditing Policy configuration process to get you started.



</p>
<h5>Step 1: Attach Policy</h5>
<p>Go to the Policies folder in the Root Organization and attach the Basic Auditing Policy  to a web service, operation, or binding that you would like to audit.</p>
<h5>Step 2: Test Policy and View Monitoring Data</h5>
<p>After you've attached the Basic Auditing Policy  to a web service, operation, or binding, send a request to your service and go to the <em>Services &gt; Monitoring</em> section to view the results for Logs, Real Time Charts, and Historical Charts. For more information on using the monitoring functions, refer to the Policy Manager Online Help, available via the Help button.</p>
