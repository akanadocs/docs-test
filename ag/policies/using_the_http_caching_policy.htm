<a name="introduction"></a><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>An SOA Container is involved in the processing of messages prior to their delivery to a service implementation. The performance of message processing can be enhanced through the caching of responses to previously made service requests. The cached responses can be returned without paying the overhead of invoking the service implementation.</p>
<p>The HTTP Caching Policy is an Operational policy that allows you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define how long a response can be cached for HTTP requests.</li>
  <li>Select a caching mode (HTTP Proxy Mode or HTTP Mediation/Server Mode).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: This policy was introduced with Policy Manager 7.2.</em></p>



<a name="modes"></a><h3>HTTP Caching Policy Modes</h3>
<p>The HTTP Caching policy supports the following modes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTTP Proxy Mode</strong>: Using this mode, the container expects the downstream call to be HTTP and to return cache control headers. If the downstream call does not meet these requirements, responses are not cached when the Authorization header is sent in the request.</li>
  <li><strong>HTTP Mediation / Server Mode</strong>: Using this mode, the presence or absence of downstream headers is not taken into consideration. The caching decisions are based completely on the client cache-control headers, and the default behavior is used for the Authorization header. This means that the Authorization header is used in the cache key, and the responses are cached individually per authenticated user. 
</li>
</ul>

<a name="manage_cache"></a><h3>How Stale Caches are Managed</h3>
<p>When a message is processed and the headers are read, a determination is made as to whether the cache is stale or not. If a cache is discovered to be stale, response validators are used to send a conditional response to the originating server. If it's determined that the cache is not stale, the cached response is used. Otherwise, a full response will be received that will be used instead of the cached response. For more information on the stale cache handling approach used for this policy, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html</a></p>

<a name="options"></a><h3>HTTP Caching Policy Options</h3>
<p>The policy includes the following configuration options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Time To Live</strong>: Allows you to specify the maximum time in seconds a response will be cached. If not specified, the maximum time is determined by the container settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Staleness Period Seconds</strong>: If a value is entered, any cached entry will live in the cache for the number of seconds in Time To Live, plus the number of seconds in Staleness Period.&nbsp; The &quot;stale&quot; portion of the entry will only be used if Cache-Control directives on the request allow for a stale entry to be used, by the use of a max-stale directive. The default is 0.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Act as HTTP Proxy</strong>: Uncheck to enable either the HTTP Proxy Mode (checked) or HTTP Mediation / Server Mode.</li>
  <li><strong>Shared Cache</strong>: Uncheck to enable the ability to use a private cache. In this case, you must also select a Subject Category (below).</li>
  <li><strong>Subject Category</strong>: Allows you to select a subject category if Shared Cache is unchecked. The subject category is used to find the cache's principal name that is set when the cache is created, and use it as part of the cache key.</li>
</ul>

<a name="cache"></a><h3>Public/Private Caching</h3>
<p>By default, the caching module considers itself to be a shared (public) cache (<strong>Shared Cache</strong> checked), and will not, for example, cache responses to requests with Authorization headers or responses marked with <strong>Cache-Control: private</strong>. If, however, the cache is only going to be used by one logical &quot;user&quot; (behaving similarly to a browser cache), then you will want to turn off the shared cache setting (<strong>Shared Cache </strong>unchecked).</p>

<a name="configuration"></a><h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the HTTP Caching Policy configuration process to get you started.</p>
<h5>Step 1: Add Policy / Use System Policy</h5>
<p>In Policy Manager, to create an HTTPS Caching Quota Policy instance, go to <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong> and choose <strong>Add Policy</strong>.</p>
<h5>Step 2: Modify Policy</h5>
<p>When you click <strong>Modify</strong> to make changes to the HTTP Caching policy on the <strong>Policy Details</strong> page, the initial policy looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/modify_http_caching_policy.jpg" width="456" height="478" alt="" /></p>
<p>Configure the policy options based on your requirements and click <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/http_cache_policy_summary.jpg" width="498" height="145" alt="" /></p>
<h5>Step 3: Attach Policy</h5>
<p>After you've saved your policy, you can attach it to a web service, binding, or binding operation that you would like to enhance the message processing of.</p>
<h5>Step 4: Test Policy and View Monitoring Data</h5>
<p>After you've attached the HTTPS Caching Policy to a web service, operation, or binding, send a request to your service and go to the <em>Services &gt; Monitoring</em> section to view the results for Logs, Real Time Charts, and Historical Charts. For more information on using the monitoring functions, refer to the Policy Manager Online Help, available via the Help button.</p>
