<h3 id="ws_sec_verif_sig_about">About the WS-Security Verify Signature Component</h3>
<p>Policy Manager provides a &quot;WS-Security Verify Signature Component&quot; that is used to verify signatures based on the OASIS WS-Security Standard.</p>
<p>Note: The WS-Security Verify Signature implementation complies with the &quot;Signatures &gt; Signature Validation&quot; specification outlined in the &quot;WS-Security SOAP Message Security 1.0&quot; specification.</p>
<p>For general information on adding this policy component to the Request or Response Configuration of your policy and available configuration options see Configure Policy Components.</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<h3 id="ws_sec_verif_sig_create">Creating a WS-Security Verify Signature Component policy</h3>
<p>The first step in creating a policy is to define the basic policy information. Then, you can configure the policy details.</p>
<h5>To add an operational policy</h5>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong>, and select <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong>. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add Policy</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose the policy type and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
<li>Specify a name (required) and description (optional) and click <strong>Finish</strong>. The <strong>Add Policy</strong> Wizard creates a draft policy instance that you can then configure on the <strong>Policy Details</strong> page.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see <a href="policy_management.htm#add_policy">Add Policy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ws_sec_verif_sig_config">Configure WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component</h3>
<p>The following usage example illustrates how to configure a &quot;WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component.&quot; The exercise steps through the component options and provides configuration instructions. Refer to the help topics for functional details on each component option.</p>
<p>This procedure assumes you are logged into the &quot;Management Console,&quot; have added a Pipeline Policy, the &quot;Modify Pipeline Policy&quot; base configuration is completed, and the &quot;WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component&quot; has been added to the &quot;Request Configuration&quot; and &quot;Response Configuration.&quot;</p>
<p>To configure ws-security verify timestamp component in a policy:</p>
<p>Enter the following navigation path: Workbench &gt; Browse &gt; Organization. Select the &quot;Policies&quot; folder. The &quot;Policies Summary&quot; screen displays.</p>
<p>To navigate to the &quot;Policy Details&quot; tab, click the policy &quot;Name,&quot; double-click the &quot;Pipeline Policy&quot; line item, or select &quot;View Policy Details&quot; from the &quot;Actions&quot; drop-down list box. The &quot;Pipeline Policy Details&quot; displays.</p>
<p>On the &quot;Modify Pipeline Policy Portlet,&quot; click &quot;Modify.&quot; The &quot;Modify Pipeline Policy&quot; screen displays. A sample policy configuration with an instance of the &quot;WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component&quot; could look like this:</p>
<p>policy_example_with_verify_timestamp.jpg</p>
<p>Figure. Modify Pipeline Policy—with WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component</p>
<p>To configure the &quot;WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component,&quot; double-click the component name or select the component line item and click &quot;Modify Component.&quot; The &quot;Modify WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component&quot; screen displays.</p>
<p>wss_verify_timestamp_component.jpg</p>
<p>Figure. WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component</p>
<p>Enter the following &quot;WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component&quot; configuration information:</p>
<p>Verify Timestamps</p>
<p>Select the timestamp verification method you would like to apply to the message:</p>
<p>Verify Expiration Timestamp Only</p>
<p>A radio button that enables the verification of an Expiration Timestamp only. This is the default selection.</p>
<p>Verify Expiration Timestamp or Creation Timestamp</p>
<p>A radio button that verifies the Expiration Timestamp and Creation Timestamp. To configure the Creation Timestamp enter the number of seconds the represents the expiration time of the Creation Timestamp. This is a required field.</p>
<p>Advanced Options</p>
<p>Actor</p>
<p>Enter the URI of the actor attribute of the WS-Security Header that includes the timestamp header you would like to verify. The actor attribute can be used to indicate which recipient should process the verification of the timestamp header. If the actor is omitted, it means that verification of the timestamp header is targeted to final endpoint. Use of this feature is optional.</p>
<p>Generate Audit Data</p>
<p>Click the Audit checkbox if you would like to log all activity associated with the execution of the &quot;WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component.&quot; If this option is not selected, the system logs failure only. Use of this feature is optional.</p>
<p>Refer to WS-Security Verify Timestamp_Component_Key_Functionality for information on each option.</p>
<p>After you have completed the configuration process, click &quot;Apply&quot; to commit the changes.</p>

<h3 id="ws_sec_verif_sig_functionality">WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component Key Functionality</h3>
<p>The &quot;WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component&quot; is a Policy Manager policy component that can be configured in a Request or Response Configuration of a policy definition. Each component should be placed in a Request or Response Configuration relative to how message requests and responses will be processed. The following section provides an overview of key functionality.</p>
<p>Component Functionality</p>
<p>Component Placement in Policy Configuration</p>
<p>The &quot;WS-Security Verify Timestamp Component&quot; can be placed in the Request or Response Configuration.</p>
<p>Verify Timestamps</p>
<p>This component provides two timestamp verification options:</p>
<p>Verify Expiration Timestamp only</p>
<p>Verifies the Expiration Timestamp expiration as its default behavior. At runtime, a SOAP message will be rejected if its expiration time is before the current time.</p>
<p>Verify Expiration Timestamp and Creation Timestamp</p>
<p>Verifies both the Expiration Timestamp and Creation Timestamp. The Creation Timestamp expiration is configured by specifying a message expiration time in seconds. At runtime, this component will check the following two conditions:</p>
<p>If the expiration Timestamp of a SOAP message is before the current time, the message will be considered invalid and be rejected.</p>
<p>If the creation Timestamp of a SOAP message is before the current time minus the message expiration time, the message will be considered invalid and be rejected. This ensures the &quot;freshness&quot; of the message.</p>
<p>Note: The message expiration time should be set properly to accommodate the network latency for the  messages to transfer  from source to destination and the clock skewness between the clocks of the sender and the receiver.</p>
<p>Advanced Options</p>
<p>The following advanced options can be configured:</p>
<p>Actor</p>
<p>This parameter specifies a URI that should be set as the actor attribute of WS-Security header associated with the timestamp header to be verified. Example syntax could look like this:</p>
<pre>  mustUnderstand=&quot;…&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;/wsse:Security&gt;</pre>
<p>The optional actor attribute can be used to indicate which recipient should process the timestamp header. If the actor is omitted, it means that timestamp header is targeted to final endpoint. The Actor value must conform to a supported Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) format.</p>
<p>Note: This implemention of the &quot;WS-Security Insert Timestamp Component&quot; supports &quot;mustUnderstand=True&quot; by default.</p>
<p>Generate Audit Data Audit</p>
<p>If this parameter is checked, the execution status of this component will be logged as part of audit trail. If this option is not selected, the execution status of this component will be logged only when there is error while executing this component.</p>
