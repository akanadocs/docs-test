<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A Concurrency Quota Policy is a Quality of Service (QoS) policy that allows you to monitor the web service concurrency performance by specifying a concurrency limit (quota) that represents the maximum number of connections, and configuring fault and alert notifications.</p>
<p>You can define a fault message by specifying the following values:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Name (Fault Message)</li>
	<li>SOAP fault element that holds errors and status information for a SOAP message (Fault Element Name)</li>
	<li>URL that points to the fault code schema (Fault Namespace URI)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also define Alert Codes in the <strong>Alerts</strong> &gt; <strong>Alert Codes</strong> section and enable and select them in the policy definition.</p>
<p>If the specified concurrency limit is exceeded, Policy Manager returns a fault and sends an alert.</p>



<h2 id="concurrency_quota_create">Creating a Concurrency Quota Policy</h2>
<p>The first step in creating a policy is to define the basic policy information.</p>

<h4>To add a QoS policy</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong>, and select <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>QoS Policies</strong>. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add Policy</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose the policy type and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li>Specify a name (required) and description (optional) and click <strong>Finish</strong>. At the <strong>Completion Summary</strong>, click <strong>Close</strong>. The <strong>Add Policy</strong> Wizard creates a draft policy instance that you can then configure on the <strong>Policy Details</strong> page.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see <a href="policy_management.htm#add_policy">Add Policy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="options">Concurrency Quota Policy Options</h2>
<p>The policy includes the configuration options listed below.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Concurrency Limit</strong>: Allows you to specify a concurrency limit (quota) that represents the maximum number of concurrency connections. If the limit is exceeded, a fault message is returned to the consumer and an alert is logged.</li>
	<li><strong>Fault Message</strong>: The name of the SOAP fault message to be returned if the quota is exceeded (&lt;faultString&gt;).</li>
	<li><strong>Fault Element Name</strong>: The name of the SOAP fault element that holds errors and status information for a SOAP message.</li>
	<li><strong>Fault Namespace URI</strong>: The URL that points to the fault code schema.</li>
	<li><strong>Fault Namespace Prefix</strong>: Allows you to enter the fault namespace prefix.</li>
	<li><strong>Time to Clear Alert(s)</strong>: Allows you to enter the length of time for which the throughput needs to be within the limit before a second alert is sent to signify that the consumer is once again within the quota.</li>
	<li><strong>Set Reminder Alert</strong>: Enables the Reminder Alert function. This function sends the alert that is selected on the Alert Code drop-down list. The alert is sent at the <strong>Reminder Alert Interval</strong> until the consumer is within the quota.</li>
	<li><strong>Reminder Alert Interval(s)</strong>: Allows you to enter an interval (in seconds) at which Reminder Alerts will be sent until the consumer is within the quota.</li>
	<li><strong>Alert Code</strong>: A drop-down menu that displays a list of custom alert codes that you have defined. If you have &quot;Send Reminder Alert&quot; selected, alerts will be sent based on the alert interval defined using the selected Alert Code. For more information on defining an Alert Code, see <a href="../alerts/using_alert_codes.htm">Using Alert Codes</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Clear Alert Code</strong>: A drop-down menu that displays a list of custom alert codes that you have defined. If you have &quot;Send Reminder Alert&quot; selected, alerts are sent when the alert condition no longer exists.</li>
	<li><strong>Reminder Alert Code</strong>: A drop-down menu that displays a list of custom alert codes that you have defined. If you have &quot;Send Reminder Alert&quot; selected, alerts are sent based on the specified interval when the condition continues to be exceeded.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the Concurrency Quota Policy configuration process to get you started.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Add Policy</h4>
<p>In Policy Manager, to create a Concurrency Quota Policy instance, go to <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>QoS Policies</strong> and choose <strong>Add Policy</strong>.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Modify Policy</h4>
<p>When you click <strong>Modify</strong> to make changes to the Concurrency Quota Policy on the <strong>Policy Details</strong> page, the initial policy looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/concurrency_quota.jpg" alt="Modify Concurrency Quota page" /></p>
<p>Configure the policy options based on your requirements and click <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>


<h4 id="step_03_act">Step 3: Activate Policy</h4>
<p>When the policy configuration is complete, activate the policy so that you can use it.</p>


<h4>Step 4: Attach Policy</h4>
<p>After you've saved and activated your policy, you can attach it to a web service, operation, or binding.</p>


<h4>Step 5: Test Policy and View Monitoring Data</h4>
<p>After you've attached the Concurrency Quota Policy to a web service, operation, or binding, send a request to your service and go to the <strong>Services</strong> &gt; <strong>Monitoring</strong> section to view the results for Logs, Real Time Charts, and Historical Charts.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="policy_activating">Activating a policy</h2>
<p>When you create and configure a policy, the policy is in <strong>Draft</strong> state. When the policy configuration is complete, activate the policy: click <strong>Activate Policy</strong> and then confirm. See <a href="policy_management.htm#policy_activate">Activate a Policy</a>.</p>
<p>A policy in Draft state is not available for general use. Once you activate the policy, it is in <strong>Active</strong> state and is available for use.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="policy_attach">Attaching a policy</h2>
<p>To use the policy, go to the <strong>Policies</strong> folder in the respective organization and attach the policy to a web service, binding, or binding operation.</p>
