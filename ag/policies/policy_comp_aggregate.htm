<h2 id="comp_aggregate_about">About the Compliance Aggregate policy</h2>
<p>a Compliance Aggregate Policy is a collection of compliance policies that are gathered together to form a policy group. Policies included in a Compliance Aggregate Policy are defined to achieve a specific purpose relative to governing Policy Manager objects (Organizations, Services, and so on).</p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="comp_aggregate_create">Creating a Compliance Aggregate Policy</h2>
<p>The first step in creating a policy is to define the basic policy information.</p>

<h4>To add a compliance policy</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong>, and select <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Compliance Policies</strong>. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add Policy</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose the policy type and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li>Specify a name (required) and description (optional) and click <strong>Finish</strong>. At the <strong>Completion Summary</strong>, click <strong>Close</strong>. The <strong>Add Policy</strong> Wizard creates a draft policy instance that you can then configure on the <strong>Policy Details</strong> page.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see <a href="policy_management.htm#add_policy">Add Policy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="comp_aggregate_config">Configuring a Compliance Aggregate Policy</h2>
<p>a Compliance Aggregate Policy is a containment policy that allows you to create a logical grouping of Policy Manager Compliance policies. Essentially, you first create the Compliance Aggregate policy, and then you add and configure each Compliance Policy that you want to include in the Compliance Aggregate policy. You can also define a new Compliance Policy in the context of the Compliance Aggregate policy.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Each policy must be configured as a separate entity.</li>
	<li>Policies can be directly added to a Compliance Aggregate Policy, and exist inside the logical grouping.</li>
	<li>You can reference policies that have already been defined, from within the Compliance Aggregate policy. In this scenario, the policies still display in their original location within Policy Manager but also display as part of the Compliance Aggregate policy.</li>
	<li>A Compliance Aggregate Policy can include both newly defined and existing (referenced) policies.</li>
	<li>If you change a policy that's referenced by one or more Aggregate policies, the change applies to all instances of the policy&#8212;the original instance and every occurrence within a Compliance Aggregate Policy.</li>
	<li>You can attach the Compliance Aggregate policy to objects such as services in the same way that you'd attach any other policy.</li>
</ul>

<h4>To define new policies in a Compliance Aggregate Policy</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong> and select the <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Compliance Policies</strong> folder. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Find the policy on the list and click to go to the <strong>Details</strong> page for the policy.</li>
	<li>In the second panel, in the <strong>Policies</strong> section, click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first new policy.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Select Policy Creation Option</strong> page, choose the policy type that you're adding and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li>Specify the policy name and then click <strong>Finish</strong>, then click <strong>Close</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the <strong>Details</strong> page for the policy you just added, click <strong>Modify</strong>. Configure the policy details as you normally would. The configuration options are different for each policy. For a full list of policies, with links to policy documentation details, see <a href="about_policies_view.htm">About Policies</a>.</li>
	<li>In the left pane, click the Compliance Aggregate policy. In the center pane, click <strong>Add</strong> to add a second policy. Repeat steps 4 through 7 as needed to add all the policies you need in your Aggregate policy.</li>
</ol>

<h4>To reference existing policies in a Compliance Aggregate Policy</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong> and select the <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Compliance Policies</strong> folder. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Find the policy on the list and click to go to the <strong>Details</strong> page for the policy.</li>
	<li>In the second panel, in the Policy References section, click <strong>Modify</strong> to reference the first existing policy.</li>
	<li>In the Organization Tree that opens, check the boxes for one or more existing policies, and then click <strong>Apply</strong>. The policies are added to the Compliance Aggregate policy.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="policy_activating">Activating a policy</h2>
<p>When you create and configure a policy, the policy is in <strong>Draft</strong> state. When the policy configuration is complete, activate the policy: click <strong>Activate Policy</strong> and then confirm.</p>
<p>A policy in Draft state is not available for general use. Once you activate the policy, it is in <strong>Active</strong> state and is available for use.</p>

<h2 id="policy_attach">Attaching a policy</h2>
<p>To use the Compliance Aggregate policy, go to the <strong>Policies</strong> folder in the respective organization and attach the policy to a web service, binding, or binding operation.</p>
