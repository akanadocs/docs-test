<h1 id="top">About Compliance Policies</h1>
<p>Compliance policies allow organizations to create standards that control the quality of the data in the repository. These policies can be used to analyze the service metamodel, WSDL documents, Schema, and transactional data to determine whether they meet corporate standards.</p>
<p>A Compliance Policy is added using the <strong>Add Policy</strong> function. After a Compliance Policy instance is added, it is configured with a compliance rule. A compliance rule is a test against the service WSDL, UDDI document message, or other aspects of the service metadata model. You can combine a number of Compliance Policies, each representing one compliance rule, in a <strong>Compliance Aggregate Policy</strong>.</p>
<p>You can attach one or more Compliance Policies (rules) to Policy Manager objects (for example, organizations or services). The policies are then executed as part of the compliance check. You can also import policies (and rules) from an XML document using the <strong>Import Package</strong> function.</p>
<p>Only the System Administrator can create and manage Compliance Policies. Compliance Policies are accessible from the <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Compliance</strong> tab.</p>
<p>In the Policy Manager console, choose <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>Compliance</strong> Polices to view, add, modify, delete, and manage references for Compliance Policies.</p>
