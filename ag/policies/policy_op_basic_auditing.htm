<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Basic Auditing Policy is an out-of-the-box policy that is part of the Policy Manager default installation. It is an instance of the <strong>Auditing Service Policy</strong>; it provides basic auditing of messages and records the message metrics in the <strong>Monitoring</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong> tab. The policy is located in the <strong>Policies</strong> folder of the root Organization.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: </p>
<p>The following message metrics are recorded, but the policy does not audit the messages themselves. If you need full message auditing, use the <strong>Detailed Auditing</strong> policy.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Message Size</strong>: Audits the size of messages in the exchange.</li>
	<li><strong>Binding</strong>: Audits binding information.</li>
	<li><strong>Contract</strong>: Audits the contract governing a message.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following identities are audited:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Consumer</strong>: Audits consumer identity sent with a request message.</li>
	<li><strong>End User</strong>: Audits end-user identity sent with a request message.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/basicauditing_2019.jpg" alt="Basic Auditing" /></p>
<p>In versions prior to 2019.0.0, the platform did not support attaching multiple auditing policies to a service or API; for example, <a href="policy_op_basic_auditing.htm">Basic Auditing</a> policy or <a href="policy_op_detailed_auditing.htm">Detailed Auditing</a> policy. In 2019.0.0 and later you can set up Basic Auditing for successful messages and Detailed Auditing for error conditions. See <a href="policy_op_detailed_auditing.htm#uc_policy_op_detail_aud_failure_basic_aud_success">Detailed Auditing on failure, Basic Auditing on success</a>.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: For explanations of the individual fields, see <a href="policy_op_auditing_service.htm#auditing_service_policy_config">Configuring an Auditing Service Policy</a>. The Basic Auditing Policy and Detailed Auditing Policy are both pre-configured out-of-the-box instances of the Auditing Service Policy that are part of the default installation.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the Basic Auditing Policy configuration process to get you started.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Attach Policy</h4>
<p>Go to the Policies folder in the Root Organization and attach the Basic Auditing Policy to a web service, operation, or binding that you would like to audit.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Test Policy and View Monitoring Data</h4>
<p>After you've attached the Basic Auditing Policy to a web service, operation, or binding, send a request to your service and go to the <strong>Services</strong> &gt; <strong>Monitoring</strong> section to view the results for Logs, Real Time Charts, and Historical Charts.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="policy_activating">Activating a policy</h2>
<p>When you create and configure a policy, the policy is in <strong>Draft</strong> state. When the policy configuration is complete, activate the policy: click <strong>Activate Policy</strong> and then confirm. See <a href="policy_management.htm#policy_activate">Activate a Policy</a>.</p>
<p>A policy in Draft state is not available for general use. Once you activate the policy, it is in <strong>Active</strong> state and is available for use.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="policy_attach">Attaching a policy</h2>
<p>To use the policy, go to the <strong>Policies</strong> folder in the respective organization and attach the policy to a web service, binding, or binding operation.</p>

<h2 id="uc_policy_qos_basic_auditing_pm">Basic Auditing Policy: use case for Policy Manager</h2>
<p>This section provides a usage scenario for use of the Basic Auditing policy in Policy Manager. In this scenario, the policy is used to audit basic message metrics.</p>

<h3>Audit Basic Message Metrics</h3>
<p>Audit basic message metrics of each exchange in usage logs of the Monitoring tab.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a physical service in the <strong>Policy Manager Management Console</strong> using <strong>Create Physical Service</strong>.</li>
	<li>Provide service details and finish the wizard.</li>
	<li>Using <strong>Virtualize Service</strong>, virtualize and host the physical service on Network Director (<strong>ND1</strong>), and assign a name (for example, <strong>Vs1</strong>).</li>
	<li>Attach the Basic Auditing Policy located in the Root Organization Policies folder to the Vs1 service in <strong>Service Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Policy Attachments</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong>.</li>
	<li>Send requests from the application/client to the in <strong>Service Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Policy Attachments</strong> &gt; <strong>Operational Policies</strong>. service.</li>
	<li>The details in the usage logs show the recorded information for each exchange.
	<p><img src="images/basic_auditing_uc_pm_01.jpg" alt="" /></p>
	<p>The fields that are recorded in each exchange are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Message Size</li>
			<li>Contract</li>
			<li>Binding</li>
			<li>Identities: Consumer/End-User</li>
		</ol>
