<h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p>The Operational Metrics Policy allows you to specify  what operational  metrics should be gathered. It differs from an auditing policy in that metrics  are only numeric values that can be charted, and they contain no information about the content  of the message.
</p>
<p>Instead of collecting all metrics, data capture can be performed at a more granular level to serve specific reporting requirements. For example, you may want to monitor where the maximum API traffic is coming from based on a service, organization, operation, license, binding type, etc. to determine the best location to place your data center. With this policy you can configure the collection of a specific metric type <em>and</em> can also filter the data capture based on a specific dimension.</p>
<h4>Metrics</h4>
<p>You can enable the collection of <em>all</em> or <em>selected</em> metrics types. Options include: </p>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">

  <li>Response Size </li>
</ul>
<h4>Dimensions</h4>
<p>You can enable the collection of <em>all</em> or <em>selected</em> dimensions. Options include:</p>

</ul>
