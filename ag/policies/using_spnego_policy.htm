<h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p>The SPNEGO policy is an Operational policy that implements the  Microsoft authored SPNEGO WS-Policy assertion (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee525179.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee525179.aspx</a>). It states the requirement of supporting the SPNEGO Negotiate authenticate scheme. Not all services and their consumers may support both the NTLM and Kerberos options for SPNEGO. It is only required that both parties support at least one option in common. The subject category of the identity used in the negotiation is End-User and is not configurable.  </p>
<p> The <a href="http://docs.soa.com/ag/assets/kerberos_support_v71.pdf">Kerberos Support in Policy Manager 7.1</a> document includes  the following  Kerberos usage scenarios that illustrate usage of the SPNEGO Policy.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3></a>
<p>Let's take a quick walkthrough of the SPNEGO Policy configuration process to get your started.

</p>
<h5>Step 1: Add Policy / Use System Policy</h5>
<ul class="usingOrderedList">
  <li>In Policy Manager, you can create a SPNEGO Policy instance using <strong>Add Policy</strong> in the <em>Policies &gt; Operational Policies</em> section. </li>
  <li><em>Note: The SPNEGO Policy does not require any configuration. </em></li>
</ul>
<h5>Step 2: Attach Policy</h5>
<p>After you have saved your policy you can  attach it to a downstream web service  or operation that you would like to capture roll-up data for. </p>

<h5>Step 3: Test Policy and View Monitoring Data</h5>
<p>After you attached the SPNEGO Policy to a  service or operation, send a request to your service and go to the <em>Services &gt; Monitoring</em> section to view the results for Logs, Real Time Charts, and Historical Charts. Refer to the Policy Manager Online Help (i.e., Help button) for more information on the using the monitoring functions.</p>
