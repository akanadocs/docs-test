<p>Learn how to define conditions for measuring and reporting on API performance.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: This policy does not enforce service level, and does not operate in real time. Service level is checked at intervals as defined in the policy configuration, and alerts are generated if a defined rule is violated, but this policy does not block service calls. To block service calls, use this policy together with the <a href="policy_qos_service_level_enforcement.htm">Service Level Enforcement</a> policy.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Service Level Policy defines conditions for measuring and reporting performance of a specific contract. </p>
<p>Note that this policy measures and reports on service level. It provides metrics, but it does not block any service calls.</p>
<p>In this policy, you can define:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Rule (one or more)</strong>: Each rule represents a set of conditions you define to measure and report performance of a service contract. When a defined system condition matches a defined rule, an alert is raised. A <strong>Rule</strong> is composed of <strong>Rule Elements</strong> (Alert Code, Metric, Operator, Value, Units, and Interval) that you can configure to meet your service monitoring requirements.
	<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: To see the alerts in Policy Manager: <strong>Policy Manager</strong> &gt; <strong>Workbench</strong>. Alerts are not displayed in the Community Manager developer portal, but you can see the behavior with regard to whether messages are allowed or limited by attaching a Detailed Auditing policy to the API and reviewing the metrics and logs.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Access time</strong>: Defines the time periods during which the policy is enforced. You can define access time periods uniquely for each day of the week&#8212;all day, or a start/end range (HH:MM)&#8212;and the time zone.</li>
</ul>
	<p>Here's how it works:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The platform collects statistics for all API calls. The raw data is recorded in the database.</li>
		<li>Platform processes run at intervals to analyze the data to see if any Service Level Policy limits have been reached.
		<p>The platform uses the time frame specified in the policy rule (see <a href="#fielddef_interval">Interval</a> below). For example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A rule limit of 5 faults per hour is checked each hour, on the hour.</li>
			<li>A limit of 100 transactions per 15 minutes is checked on the quarter-hour (for example, 1:00, 1:15, 1:30, 1:45).</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	
		<li><strong>Alert</strong>: If a rule has been violated for the specified interval, an alert is generated.</li>
		<li><strong>&quot;Clearing&quot; Alert</strong>: At the next scheduled interval, the rule is checked again. The platform applies the following logic:
			<ul>
				<li>If the message count is still exceeded, no action is taken; there is no additional alert, but the alert is not cleared.</li>
				<li>If a rule is no longer exceeded, the Service Level Policy generates a &quot;<strong>Clearing</strong>&quot; alert  to notify users that the violation is over.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

<h2 id="service_level_policy_create">Creating a Service Level policy</h2>
<p>The first step in creating a policy is to define the basic policy information.</p>

<h4>To add a Quality of Service (QoS) policy</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong>, and select <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>QoS Policies</strong>. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add Policy</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose the policy type and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li>Specify a name (required) and description (optional) and click <strong>Finish</strong>. At the <strong>Completion Summary</strong>, click <strong>Close</strong>. The <strong>Add Policy</strong> Wizard creates a draft policy instance that you can then configure on the <strong>Policy Details</strong> page.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see <a href="policy_management.htm#add_policy">Add Policy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="service_level_policy_config">Configuring a Service Level policy</h2>
<p>To configure your Service Level policy, follow the steps below.</p>

<h4 id="proc_service_level_policy_config">To configure a Service Level policy</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Create the policy as covered above.</li>
	<li>At the <strong>Policies Summary</strong> page, in the <strong>Service Level Policy</strong> section, click <strong>Modify</strong>. The <strong>Modify Service Level Policy Rules</strong> page appears, as shown below.
		<p><img src="images/service_level_modifyrules.png" alt="QoS Service Level policy: Modify Service Level Policy Rules" /></p>

	<li>Add one or more rules, as needed. For information about the fields, refer to <a href="#service_level_policy_config_rules">Configuring Service Level Policy Rules</a> below.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. The <strong>Modify Service Level Policy Access Time</strong> page appears, as shown below.
	<p><img src="images/service_level_modifyaccesstime.png" alt="QoS Service Level policy: Modify Service Level Policy Access Time" /></p></li>
	<li>Configure values for the access times, for each day of the week, and specify time zone. For information about the fields, refer to <a href="#service_level_policy_config_access_time_options">Configuring Security Level Policy Access Time options</a> below.</li>
	<li>When done, click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the <strong>Completion Summary</strong> page, click <strong>Close</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="service_level_policy_config_rules">Configuring Service Level Policy Rules</h2>
<p>Rules represent the conditions you define to measure and report performance for the specific service that is referencing or contains the configuration of a Service Level Policy. When a defined system condition matches a defined rule, an alert is generated.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can select from available SLA Custom Alert Codes in the drop-down list box on the Alert Code field. You can also enter a new SLA Custom Alert Code directly into the Service Level Policy Rule line item. The minimum SLA Alert Code start number is 700000. For more information on defining an Alert Code, see <a href="../alerts/using_alert_codes.htm">Using Alert Codes</a>.</p>
<p>A rule is composed of the elements shown below.</p>
<table class="doctable">
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Rule Element</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td>Alert Code</td>
		<td><p>The Alert Code identification number that represents the alert that is sent when the defined condition is met.</p>

			<p><img src="images/service_level_alertcode.png" alt="Service Level Policy: Alert Code field" /></p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Metric</td>
		<td><p>A measurable function (such as a Response Time) that is used in the rule calculation. Valid values:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Average Response Time</li>

				<li>Total Request Message Size</li>
				<li>Total Response Message Size</li>
				<li>Max Request Message Size</li>
				<li>Min Request Message Size</li>
			</ul>
		<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Total</strong> metric options for request and response message size represent the combined size of all the message payloads over the time period.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Operator</td>
		<td><p>A symbol representing a mathematical function, such as &gt; (greater than) or &lt;+ (less than or equal to), used to limit or expand your search to qualify the metric. Available values are shown below.</p>

<h3 id="rule_example_01">Example Rule Definition</h3>
<p>Send alert code [30002] when the [Maximum Response Time] for Service Operation is:</p>
<p>[&gt;] [5] [Seconds] in a [1 hour] time interval.</p>
<p>Before you begin creating rules, review the list of available alert codes to determine which codes you want to use. One common approach is to establish a series of two or three thresholds, each using the same metric:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The first threshold indicates that there might be a problem with a service monitored by the Service Level Policy.</li>
	<li>The second indicates that there is a problem, but it might not be a serious one.</li>
	<li>The third is a warning that there is a major problem that needs to be addressed immediately.</li>

<h2 id="policy_activating">Activating a policy</h2>
<p>When you create and configure a policy, the policy is in <strong>Draft</strong> state. When the policy configuration is complete, activate the policy: click <strong>Activate Policy</strong> and then confirm. See <a href="policy_management.htm#policy_activate">Activate a Policy</a>.</p>
<p>A policy in Draft state is not available for general use. Once you activate the policy, it is in <strong>Active</strong> state and is available for use.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="policy_attach">Attaching a policy</h2>
<p>To use the Service Level policy, go to the <strong>Policies</strong> folder in the respective organization and attach the policy to a web service, binding, or binding operation.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="policy_test">Testing the Policy and Viewing Monitoring Data</h2>
<p>After you've attached the Service Level Policy to a web service, operation, or binding, send a request to your service and go to the <strong>Services</strong> &gt; <strong>Monitoring</strong> section to view the results for Logs, Real Time Charts, and Historical Charts.</p>

<h2 id="uc_policy_qos_service_level_pm_00">Service Level Policy: use cases for Policy Manager</h2>
<p>This section provides a list of Policy Manager-specific usage scenarios for the Service Level Policy.</p>
<p>It includes:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#uc_policy_qos_service_level_pm_01">SLA Generates Alert / Email When Requests Exceed Limit</a></li>
	<li><a href="#uc_policy_qos_service_level_pm_02">SLA Generates Clear Alert / Email When Throughput Drops Below Limit</a></li>

	<li><a href="#uc_policy_qos_service_level_pm_04">SLA Generates Alert / Email When App Requests Sent by API Exceed Limit</a></li>
</ol>


<h3 id="uc_policy_qos_service_level_pm_01">SLA Generates Alert / Email When Requests Exceed Limit</h3>
<p>With the configuration in the example below, the Service Level policy generates an alert, and sends an email to notify the administrator that the SLA has been violated, when more than 50 requests have been sent to an API in 1 minute.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a physical service in the <strong>Policy Manager Management Console</strong> using <strong>Create Physical Service</strong>.</li>
	<li>Provide service details and finish the wizard.</li>
	<li>Using <strong>Virtualize Service</strong>, virtualize and host the physical service on Network Director (<strong>ND1</strong>), and assign a name (for example, <strong>Vs1</strong>).</li>
	<li>Navigate to <strong>Organization</strong> &gt; <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>QoS Policies</strong> and use <strong>Add Policy</strong> to create a Service Level Policy.</li>
	<li>Configure the Service Level Policy as per the use case with an alert code and a usage count of greater than 50 messages in 1 minute, as shown below.
		<p><img src="images/service_level_uc_pm_01.jpg" alt="" /></p></li>
	<li>Activate the policy in the Policy Workflow portlet and attach it to the Vs1 service in the <strong>Service Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Policy Attachments</strong> &gt; <strong>QoS</strong> section.
<p>In this scenario, when there are more than 50 hits for a service in the 1-minute interval that was configured in the policy rules, an alert is triggered at the beginning of the next configured time interval (in this example, at the beginning of the next minute), and an email is sent to the administrator.</p>
	<p><img src="images/service_level_uc_pm_02.jpg" alt="" /></p></li>
</ol>


<h3 id="uc_policy_qos_service_level_pm_02">SLA Generates Clear Alert / Email When Throughput Drops Below Limit</h3>
<p>In this scenario, generate an alert because the range defined in the policy is exceeded, and then generate a clear alert that sends an email to alert the administrator when the throughput has dropped back into the defined range.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Add an alert code to the <strong>Policy Manager Management Console</strong> in the <strong>Alerts</strong> &gt; <strong>Alert Codes</strong> tab with email configuration.</li>
	<li>Create a physical service in the <strong>Policy Manager Management Console</strong> using <strong>Create Physical Service</strong>.</li>
	<li>Provide service details and finish the wizard.</li>
	<li>Using <strong>Virtualize Service</strong>, virtualize and host the physical service on Network Director (<strong>ND1</strong>), and assign a name (for example, <strong>Vs1</strong>).</li>
	<li>Navigate to <strong>Organization</strong> &gt; <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>QoS Policies</strong> and use <strong>Add Policy</strong> to create a Service Level Policy.</li>
	<li>Configure the Service Level Policy to generate the alert code you created in Step 1 for a usage count of greater than 50 in 1 minute.</li>
	<li>Activate the policy in the Policy Workflow portlet and attach it to the Vs1 service in the <strong>Service Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Policy Attachments</strong> &gt; <strong>QoS</strong> section. You will see:
<ol>
			<li>If there are more than 50 hits for the service in the 1-minute interval that was configured in the policy rules, an SLA alert is triggered at the beginning of the next configured time interval (in this example, at the beginning of the next minute), and an email is sent to the administrator.</li>
			<li>If there are no SLA violations for the next 1-minute interval, a clear alert is generated at the beginning of the next configured interval (minute).</li>
			<li>In the alert, email has to be configured so as to send an email to the administrator as below.
			<p><img src="images/service_level_uc_pm_03.jpg" alt="" /></p></li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	</ol>



<h3 id="uc_policy_qos_service_level_pm_03">Timeline Diagram</h3>
<p>The diagram below shows the points at which alerts are generated or cleared. Note that requests are still successful even after an alert is generated.</p>
<p><img src="images/service_level_uc_pm_04.jpg" alt="" /></p>


<h3 id="uc_policy_qos_service_level_pm_04">SLA Generates Alert / Email When App Requests Sent by API Exceed Limit</h3>
<p>In the example below, the SLA policy generates an alert and sends an email to the alert the administrator when more than 300 requests by a configured App have been sent to the API in a 15-minute interval.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Add an alert code to the <strong>Policy Manager Management Console</strong> in the <strong>Alerts</strong> &gt; <strong>Alert Codes</strong> tab with email configuration.</li>
	<li>Create a physical service in the <strong>Policy Manager Management Console</strong> using <strong>Create Physical Service</strong>.</li>
	<li>Provide service details and finish the wizard.</li>
	<li>Using <strong>Virtualize Service</strong>, virtualize and host the physical service on Network Director (<strong>ND1</strong>), and assign a name (for example, <strong>Vs1</strong>).</li>
	<li>Navigate to <strong>Organization</strong> &gt; <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>QoS Policies</strong> and use <strong>Add Policy</strong> to create a Service Level Policy.</li>
	<li>Configure the Service Level Policy as per the use case with the above alert code, and greater than 300 usage count in 15 minute.</li>
	<li>Activate the policy in the Policy Workflow portlet and attach it to the Vs1 service in the <strong>Service Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Policy Attachments</strong> &gt; <strong>QoS</strong> section.	</li>
</ol>
<p>If there are more than 300 hits for a service in the interval that was configured, in this case 15 minutes, the SLA alert is triggered at the beginning of the next 15-minute interval.</p>
