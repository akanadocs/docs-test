<h2 id="qos_throughput_quota_intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>A Throughput Quota Policy is a Quality of Service (QoS) policy that allows you to monitor web service throughput performance by specifying a throughput limit (quota), and by configuring fault and alert notifications.</p>
<p>If the quota is exceeded, a <strong>Consumer Fault Message</strong> is returned to the service consumer and an alert is logged.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="qos_throughput_quota_create">Creating a Throughput Quota Policy</h2>
<p>The first step in creating a policy is to define the basic policy information.</p>

<h4>To add a Quality of Service policy</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong>, and select <strong>Policies</strong> &gt; <strong>QoS Policies</strong>. The <strong>Policies Summary</strong> is displayed.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add Policy</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose the policy type and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li>Specify a name (required) and description (optional) and click <strong>Finish</strong>. At the <strong>Completion Summary</strong>, click <strong>Close</strong>. The <strong>Add Policy</strong> Wizard creates a draft policy instance that you can then configure on the <strong>Policy Details</strong> page.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see <a href="policy_management.htm#add_policy">Add Policy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="qos_throughput_quota_config">Configuring the Throughput Quota Policy</h2>
<p>Once you've defined the basic policy information, you can configure the technical details that determine how the policy works when it's attached to a service.</p>

<h4 id="proc_http_security_policy_config">To configure the Throughput Quota policy</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Create the policy as covered above.</li>
	<li>At the <strong>Policies Summary</strong> page, in the <strong>Throughput Quota Policy</strong> section, click <strong>Modify</strong>. The <strong>Modify Throughput Quota Policy</strong> page appears, as shown below.
		<p><img src="images/throughput_quota_modify.png" alt="Modify Throughput Quota Policy page" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>Specify values for the policy. For information about the available settings, see <a href="#qos_throughput_quota_options">Throughput Quota Policy Options</a>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the policy is configured, you can attach it to a service.</p>



<h2 id="qos_throughput_quota_options">Throughput Quota Policy Options</h2>
<p>The Throughput Quota policy includes the configuration options listed below.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Throughput Limit</dt>
	<dd>Specify two values: first, the number of messages allowed; second, the time period (seconds or minutes). Example: 10000 messages per minute.</dd>
	<dt>Queue Size</dt>
	<dd>Optional (not recommended, see below): defines the concurrent threads that are queued before access is denied. This delays the consumer requests in an effort to manage a brief spike in traffic without denying access.</dd>
	<dd><strong>Note</strong>: Akana recommends that you do <strong>not</strong> use this setting. The container holds the entire content of each message in memory. There could potentially be a large number of messages held in memory, and if the messages themselves are also large, the memory and resources consumed could overwhelm the container, causing out-of-memory issues. If container restart becomes necessary, messages might be lost. In addition, a possible side-effect of slow processing is that the consumer might re-send the message. For example, if the message content includes a very large PDF file, and the message ends up in the queue, the consumer might re-send the message, which creates another instance in the queue.</dd>
	<dd>If you need this functionality, you could consider implementing a Rule in combination with a queue to help ensure the queue does not get too large. For information about rules, see <a href="../pm_rules/pm_service_rules.htm">Policy Manager Service Rules</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Fault Message</dt>
	<dd>The message that is returned if a message is rejected because the throughput limit is exceeded.</dd>
	<dt>Fault Element Name</dt>
	<dd>The name of the fault element.</dd>
	<dt>Fault Namespace URI</dt>
	<dd>Fault namespace URI.</dd>
	<dt>Fault Namespace Prefix</dt>
	<dd>Fault namespace prefix.</dd>
	<dt>Time to Clear Alert (s)</dt>
	<dd>Defines the time that the throughput needs to be within the limit before a second alert is sent to signify that the consumer is once again within quota.</dd>
	<dt>HTTP Result Code</dt>
	<dd>The HTTP code returned if a message is rejected because the throughput limit is exceeded. Must be in the 400 or 500 range.</dd>
	<dt>Send Reminder Alert</dt>
	<dd>Check the box if you want to send regular reminder alerts until the throughput is within limits.</dd>
	<dt>Reminder Alert Interval (s)</dt>
	<dd>The interval, in seconds, at which the reminder alert is sent, if checked. For example: 300s to send a reminder alert every five minutes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For examples of how you can configure these properties, see <a href="#uc_policy_qos_throughput_quota_pm">Throughput Quota Policy: use cases for Policy Manager</a> and <a href="#uc_policy_qos_throughput_quota_cm_all">Throughput Quota Policy: use cases for the Akana API Platform (Community Manager)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="policy_activating">Activating a policy</h2>
<p>When you create and configure a policy, the policy is in <strong>Draft</strong> state. When the policy configuration is complete, activate the policy: click <strong>Activate Policy</strong> and then confirm. See <a href="policy_management.htm#policy_activate">Activate a Policy</a>.</p>
<p>A policy in Draft state is not available for general use. Once you activate the policy, it is in <strong>Active</strong> state and is available for use.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="policy_attach">Attaching a policy</h2>
<p>To use the Throughput Quota policy, go to the <strong>Policies</strong> folder in the respective organization and attach the policy.</p>
<p>This policy can be attached to an organization, service, or contract. Attaching the Throughput Quota policy to an operation is not supported.</p>

<h2 id="uc_policy_qos_throughput_quota_pm">Throughput Quota Policy: use cases for Policy Manager</h2>
<p>This section provides a list of Policy Manager-specific usage scenarios for the Throughput Quota Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In a clustered scenario, you can also enable the grid counter service so that this policy works across all nodes in the cluster rather than enforcing the policy limit for each node. See <a href="../../sp/platform_management/grid_services.htm#grid_counter_enable_policy">Enabling the grid counter service for the Throughput Quota policy</a>.</p>
