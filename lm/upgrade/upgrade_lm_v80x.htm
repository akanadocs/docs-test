<p>Use the table below to determine which upgrade method to use and which set of instructions to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The process for upgrading to Lifecycle Manager 8.0.2 and later required a completely fresh install, connecting to the existing database, rather than just upgrading the container. Because of this, you must follow this approach in upgrading to the latest version from any version prior to 8.0.2. If you're installing from version 8.0.2, you can just upgrade the containers.</p>

<h2 id="lm_upgrade_802_803">Upgrading Lifecycle Manager from 8.0.2 to 8.0.3 or later (upgrade existing container)</h2>
<h4 class="stamp">Supported Platforms: 8.4.11</h4>
<p>Upgrade from 8.0.2 to 8.0.3 or later doesn't require a fresh install and reconnect to the existing database. Instead, you can just upgrade the existing containers.</p>


<h3 id="s01_01_upgrade_existing">Upgrade the existing container</h3>
<p>The general steps for upgrading from version 8.0.2 to version 8.0.3 or later by upgrading the existing container are given below.</p>
<p>The Akana Platform provides an existing <strong>configurator</strong> container that, when invoked with an appropriate set of properties, upgrades the designated target container with the most recent feature bundles found in the [platform_home]/lib directory.</p>
<p>If you're running the Akana Platform on Windows or another desktop environment, you can simply start up the configurator container without any parameters/properties, and you will be presented with a GUI dialog to select the container that you want to upgrade.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>c:\Akana\platform_home\bin\startup.bat configurator</pre>
<p>If you are running the Akana Platform on Linux (without a desktop environment), or choosing a silent install on Windows, you'll need to create an update properties file, and then invoke the configurator container in silent mode while pointing to that file. The file must contain two properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>container.instance.name</strong>, which corresponds to the container name being upgraded.</li>
  <li><strong>wizard.mode</strong>, with a value of <strong>update</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of an update properties file is shown below. This example is named <strong>update-lm.properties</strong> to reflect the name of the container being upgraded; choose whatever name you want.</p>
<pre>[akana@lm-aap84x-16 ~]$ cat ~/update-lm.properties
container.instance.name=lm
wizard.mode=update</pre>

<p>First, download the&nbsp;ZIP file for the latest version, from the Rogue Wave Support Center (See <a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm#s01_gather_zip_files">Step 1: Gather ZIP files and download to the install folder</a>).</p>
<p>Extract the new feature bundle to your Akana Platform home directory.</p>
<p>Get the feature bundle from the temporary directory in which you unzipped the Lifecycle Manager download file (See <a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm#s02_unzip_files">Step 2: Unzip installation files in the correct sequence</a>, Step 3). Inside the main ZIP file, you'll see the main Lifecycle Manager file. For example: for example, <strong>lifecyclemanager_8.0.6.xxxxx.zip</strong>.</p>
<p>In the example below, the Akana Platform home directory is <strong>/opt/akana/aap84x</strong>:</p>
<pre>[akana@lm-aap84x-16 ~]$ unzip lifecyclemanager_8.0.2.00302.zip -d /opt/akana/aap84x/
Archive:  lifecyclemanager_8.0.2.00302.zip
   creating: /opt/akana/aap84x/lib/lifecyclemanager_8.0.2.00302/
  inflating: /opt/akana/aap84x/lib/lifecyclemanager_8.0.2.00302/OpenSourceLicenses.txt
...</pre>
<p>Before upgrading an existing container, make sure that it's stopped/not running. In the example below, the target container name is <strong>lm</strong>:</p>
<pre>[akana@lm-aap84x-16 bin]$ ./shutdown.sh lm
Instance [lm] PID [48181] stopped
...
[akana@lm-aap84x-16 bin]$</pre>

<p>If you don't see the above <strong>Instance [instance_name] PID [pid#] stopped</strong> message, use the typical OS commands to verify that the Java process had been shut down; with Linux, you'd typically use the <strong>ps</strong> command. The example below positively shows that there are no active Java processes running:</p>
<pre>[akana@lm-aap84x-16 bin]$ ps -ef | grep java
akana    48404 47755  0 15:27 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto java
[akana@lm-aap84x-16 bin]$</pre>

<p>Purge the existing configurator container's <strong>cache</strong> directory, otherwise the configurator container may use some older cached feature bundles:</p>
<pre>[akana@lm-aap84x-16 ~]$ cd /opt/akana/aap84x/bin/
[akana@lm-aap84x-16 bin]$ rm -rf /opt/akana/aap84x/instances/configurator/cache/*
[akana@lm-aap84x-16 bin]$</pre>

<p>Invoke the configurator container in silent mode while specifying the full path to the upgrade properties file, as shown below. This is identical to the process used to create the LM container during initial product installation.</p>
<pre>[akana@lm-aap84x-16 bin]$ ./startup.sh configurator -Dsilent=true -Dproperties=/home/akana/properties/update-lm.properties
Starting instance [configurator]
STARTED [35] bundle(s)
Beginning task: Completing wizard...
Creating snapshot...
...
Updated 38 bundle(s).
Updating "lm" instance directory...
Configuration Completed
Exiting...
STARTED [35] bundle(s)
[akana@lm-aap84x-16 bin]$</pre>

<p>Start the newly upgraded container. In this example, the container is started in the background via the <strong>-bg</strong> parameter:</p>
<pre>[akana@lm-aap84x-16 bin]$ ./startup.sh lm -bg
Starting instance [lm]
[akana@lm-aap84x-16 bin]$</pre>
<p>That concludes the product upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="lm_upgrade_800_803">Upgrading Lifecycle Manager from 8.0.0 or 8.0.1 to 8.0.2 or later (create new container, connect to  existing database)</h2>
<h4 class="stamp">Supported Platforms: 8.4.11</h4>
<p>Upgrade from 8.0.0 or 8.0.1 to 8.0.2 or later requires an upgrade from Akana Platform 8.2.3 to 8.4.11. To perform this upgrade, you must back up, perform a fresh install, and connect to the existing database.</p>

<p>At a high level, the steps are:</p>
<ol class="table_of_contents">
  <li><a href="#upgrade_800_802_01">Step 1: Back up existing installation and complete pre-install steps</a></li>
	<li><a href="#upgrade_800_802_02">Step 2: Download ZIP files and install the Akana Platform and Lifecycle Manager, connecting to your existing database</a></li>
	<li><a href="#upgrade_800_802_03">Step 3: Verify that the upgrade was successful</a></li>
	<li><a href="#upgrade_800_802_04">Step 4: Complete post-install checks</a></li>
</ol>



<h4 id="upgrade_800_802_01">Step 1: Back up existing installation and complete pre-install steps</h4>
<p>Follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Back up your database and the Lifecycle Manager application home directory.</li>
	<li>Record your current Lifecycle Manager application settings. You can do this by noting down the LM /admin console's Settings page values, and/or use the following database query:
		<pre>select * from installprops;</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Verify that there is enough free disk space on the application server:<ul>
		<li>volume for {platform_home} directories: 1GB</li>
		<li>volume for /tmp directories: 500MB</li>
		<li>volume for logs during upgrade: 125MB</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Verify that there is enough available space on the database tablespaces. There should be at least 15% free space in each Lifecycle Manager tablespace.
	</li>
	<li>App_%.log file locations when upgrading: because the LM logging configuration for the existing installation is stored in the database, the LM app logs still persist in the pre-defined location (typically in <strong>[lm_home]/logs/webapp</strong>). For this reason, when upgrading to LM 8.0 or later, the LM logging location from the previous installation version must still exist, so that any DataUpgrade entries are captured. After a successful upgrade, you can alter the logging configuration to adjust the location to the OSGi standard of <strong>[platform_home]/instances/[instance_name]/log</strong>.</li>
	<li>Conditional, certificate setup: When LM is using HTTPS (or is behind a front-facing device using HTTPS), and/or when LM needs to use LDAPS, or integrates with another system using certificates (such as the Akana Platform), those certificates must be trusted by the Akana Platform JRE's default trust store (<strong>{platform_home}/jre/lib/security/cacerts</strong>). Use the JRE keytool command to trust the various certificates, per the steps in <a href="../sysadmin/SysAdmin-OSGi.html#ldapssl" title="Setting up LDAP over SSL" target="_blank">Setting up LDAP over SSL</a> in the Lifecycle Manager System Admin Guide.</li>
	<li>When you're ready to proceed, shut down the existing server.</li>
</ol>


<h4 id="upgrade_800_802_02">Step 2: Download ZIP files and install the Akana Platform and Lifecycle Manager, connecting to your existing database</h4>
<p>The only difference between a new install of Lifecycle Manager 8.0.2 or later and an upgrade from 8.0.0 or 8.0.1 to 8.0.2 or later is that when you're configuring the Lifecycle Manager feature for the database, you'll choose to use your existing database rather than creating a new database. In the upgrade scenario, you'll point to your existing Lifecycle Manager 8.0 database in <a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm">Step 5 of the installation procedure</a>.</p>
<p>Install Lifecycle Manager 8.0.2 or later with the Akana Platform 8.4.11.</p>
<p>For detailed instructions, including file download locations and which files to download, see <a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm">Installing Lifecycle Manager</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You will follow the <a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm">Lifecycle Manager install guide</a> up to the point of <strong>Step 5: Install and configure the Lifecycle Manager Feature</strong>. in this step, in the Database Wizard, you'll choose to use an existing database. At this point, provide the connection information to allow the connection to your existing database. Then, continue with the steps from the Lifecycle Manager install guide.</p>
<p>The feature list you'll install in Step 5 is identical for LM 8.0.1 and 8.0.2 or later.</p>
<p>The steps are summarized below:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm#s01_gather_zip_files">Step 1: Gather ZIP files and download to the install folder</a></li>

</ol>

<h4 id="upgrade_800_802_03">Step 3: Verify that the upgrade was successful</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Review the log files for any error messages.</li>
	<li>Verify the upgrade by logging on to the Lifecycle Manager admin console:
		<ul>
			<li>http://{web.server.url.host}/{contextroot}/admin/mainMenu.do</li>
			<li>Verify that the Build number is correct; for example, <b>8.0.6</b>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="upgrade_800_802_04">Step 4: Complete post-install checks</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Navigate to the LM /admin console, then verify and update any settings as appropriate.</li>
	<li>Optional: If desired, execute the following command that reset window size and location settings to the system defaults. Run this command via the LM /admin console &gt; Execute Command):
		<pre>Fully Qualified Command Class Name: ClearAllUserUIProperties

<h2 id="lm_upgrade_71_803">Upgrading Lifecycle Manager from 7.1 to 8.0.2 or later</h2>
<p>These upgrade instructions are for a scenario where you have Lifecycle Manager 7.1 installed and are upgrading <strong>from</strong> Lifecycle Manager 7.1 <strong>to</strong> the latest version of Lifecycle Manager.</p>
<p> If you are upgrading from 7.1, you can use any of the 7.1.x micro releases (including 7.1.6). Unlike the rule to sequentially iterate through the major or minor version releases, there's no need to do the same for the micro releases (such as 7.1.x). Each micro release includes all the incremental changes you'll need.</p>
<p>You can also refer to the Install and System Admin Docs for more general Lifecycle Manager information. Lifecycle Manager documentation is available:</p>
<ul>
	
	<li>As part of the product download. See <a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm">Installing Lifecycle Manager</a>.</li>
	<li>On the Akana documentation site: <a href="http://docs.akana.com/lm/index.html" title="Akana docs site, LM section" target="_self">http://docs.akana.com/lm/index.html</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upgrading from 7.1 to 8.0.2 or later requires a backup and then a fresh install of Lifecycle Manager. It includes the following steps:</p>
<ol class="table_of_contents">
	<li><a href="#upgrade_71_80_01">Step 1: Pre-Install Instructions</a></li>
	<li><a href="#upgrade_71_80_02">Step 2: Install the upgrade</a></li>
	<li><a href="#upgrade_71_80_03">Step 3: Verify that the upgrade was successful</a></li>
	<li><a href="#upgrade_71_80_04">Step 4: Post-Install Instructions</a></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="upgrade_71_80_01">Step 1: Pre-Install Instructions</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Back up your database and the Lifecycle Manager 7.1 application home directory.
		<p>The LM 7.1 to 8.3 upgrade process is a migration to the LM 8.0 as a feature in the Akana Platform. You will follow the <a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm">Lifecycle Manager 8.0 install guide</a> up to the point of &quot;Step 5: Install and configure the Lifecycle Manager Feature&quot;; in this step, in the Database Wizard, you will choose to use an existing database. At this point, you will provide the relevant connection information to allow the connection to your existing database. You then continue with the steps from the Lifecycle Manager 8.0 install guide. For details, see <a href="#upgrade_71_80_02">Install the upgrade</a> below.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Record your current 7.1 application settings. You can do this by noting down the LM /admin console's Settings page values, and/or use the following database query:
		<pre>select * from installprops;</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Verify that there is enough free disk space on the application server:
		<ul>
			<li>volume for {platform_home} directories: 1GB</li>
			<li>volume for /tmp directories: 500MB</li>
			<li>volume for logs during upgrade: 125MB</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Verify that there is enough available space on the database tablespaces for a data upgrade:
		<ul>
			<li>There should be at least 15% free space in each Lifecycle Manager tablespace.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Increase the number of application logs in your logging pool. Depending on the number of assets in your installation, the version 8.0 upgrade process doesn't contain any data upgrades, so there should be minimal log activity during the initial startup of the application. However, Akana typically recommends increasing the number of logs to at least 25. For details, refer to information about the Installation Admin command <strong>SetLoggingConfig</strong> in the Lifecycle Manager System Admin guide. After the upgrade, you can reset the number of logs in the pool to your steady-state operational level.</li>
	<li>App_%.log file locations when upgrading: as the LM 7.1 logging configuration is in the database, the LM app logs still persist in the pre-defined location (typically in <strong>[lm_home]/logs/webapp</strong>). Because of this, when installing Lifecycle Manager 8.0, the old LM 7.1 logging location directory must still exist, to ensure that any DataUpgrade entries are captured. After a successful upgrade, you can alter the logging configuration to adjust the location to the OSGi standard of <strong>[platform_home]/instances/[instance_name]/log</strong>.</li>
	<li>Conditional, certificate setup: When LM is using HTTPS (or is behind a front-facing device using HTTPS), and/or when LM needs to use LDAPS, or integrates with another system using certificates (such as the Akana Platform), those certificates must be trusted by the Akana Platform JRE's default trust store (<strong>{platform_home}/jre/lib/security/cacerts</strong>). Use the JRE keytool command to trust the various certificates, per the steps in <a href="../sysadmin/SysAdmin-OSGi.html#ldapssl" title="Setting up LDAP over SSL" target="_blank">Setting up LDAP over SSL</a> in the Lifecycle Manager System Admin Guide.</li>
</ol>


<h4 id="upgrade_71_80_02">Step 2: Install the upgrade</h4>
<p>The only difference for the upgrade scenario is that when you're configuring the Lifecycle Manager feature for the database, you'll choose to use an existing database vs creating a new database. In the upgrade scenario, you'll point to your existing Lifecycle Manager 7.1 database.</p>
