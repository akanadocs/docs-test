<a name="lm_upgrade_80_80x"></a><h3>Upgrading Lifecycle Manager from Version 8.0.0 or 8.0.1 to Version 8.0.2</h3>
<h5 class="stamp">Supported Platforms: 8.4.11</h5>
<p>If you're already on Lifecycle Manager version 8.0.0 or 8.0.1, and want to migrate to 8.0.2, you'll also need to upgrade the version of the underlying Akana API Platform to version 8.4.11.</p>
<p>At a high level, the steps are:</p>
<ol class="table_of_contents">
  <li><a href="#upgrade_80_802_01">Step 1: Back up existing installation and complete pre-install steps</a></li>
  <li><a href="#upgrade_80_802_02">Step 2: Install the Akana API Platform and Lifecycle Manager, connecting to your existing database</a></li>
  <li><a href="#upgrade_80_802_03">Step 3: Verify that the upgrade was successful</a></li>
  <li><a href="#upgrade_80_802_04">Step 4: Complete post-install checks</a></li>
</ol>



<a name="upgrade_80_802_01"></a><h5>Step 1: Back up existing installation and complete pre-install steps</h5>
<p>Follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Back up your database and the Lifecycle Manager application home directory.</li>
  <li>Record your current Lifecycle Manager application settings. You can do this by noting down the LM /admin console's Settings page values, and/or use the following database query:
    <pre>select * from installprops;</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Verify that there is enough free disk space on the application server:<ul>
    <li>volume for {platform_home} directories: 1GB</li>
    <li>volume for /tmp directories:  500MB</li>
    <li>volume for logs during upgrade: 125MB</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Verify that there is enough available space on the database tablespaces for a data upgrade:
    <ul>
      <li>There should be at least 15% free space in each Lifecycle Manager tablespace.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>App_%.log file locations when upgrading: because the LM logging configuration for the existing installation is stored in the database, the LM app logs still persist in the pre-defined location (typically in <strong>[lm_home]/logs/webapp</strong>). For this reason, when upgrading to LM 8.0.2, the LM logging location from the previous installation version must still exist, so that any DataUpgrade entries are captured. After a successful upgrade, you can alter the logging configuration to adjust the location to the OSGi standard of <strong>[platform_home]/instances/[instance_name]/log</strong>.</li>
  <li>Conditional, certificate setup: When LM is using HTTPS (or is behind a front-facing device using HTTPS), and/or when LM needs to use LDAPS, or integrates with another system using certificates (such as the Akana API Platform), those certificates must be trusted by the Akana Platform JRE's default trust store  (<strong>{platform_home}/jre/lib/security/cacerts</strong>). Use the JRE keytool command to trust the various certificates, per the steps in <a href="http://docs.akana.com/lm/SysAdmin-OSGi.html#ldapssl" title="Setting up LDAP over SSL" target="_blank">Setting up LDAP over SSL</a> in the Lifecycle Manager System Admin Guide.</li>
</ol>


<a name="upgrade_80_802_02"></a><h5>Step 2: Install the Akana API Platform and Lifecycle Manager, connecting to your existing database</h5>
<p>The only difference between a new install of Lifecycle Manager 8.0.2 and an upgrade scenario is that when you're configuring the Lifecycle Manager feature for the database, you'll choose to use your existing database rather than creating a new database. In the upgrade scenario, you'll point to your existing Lifecycle Manager 8.0 database in <a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm">Step 5 of the installation procedure</a>.</p>
<p>Install Lifecycle Manager 8.0.2 with the Akana API Platform 8.4.11.</p>
<p>For detailed instructions, see <a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm">Installing Lifecycle Manager 8.0.2</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You will follow the <a href="http://docs.akana.com/lm/install/install_lm_v80x.htm">Lifecycle Manager 8.0.2 install guide</a> up to the point of <strong>Step 5: Install and configure the Lifecycle Manager Feature</strong>. in this step, in the Database Wizard, you'll choose to use an existing database. At this point, provide the connection information to allow the connection to your existing database. Then, continue with the steps from the Lifecycle Manager 8.0.2 install guide.</p>
<p>The feature list you'll install in Step 5 is identical for LM 8.0.1 and 8.0.2.</p>
<p>The steps are summarized below:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm#01_gather_zip_files">Step 1: Gather ZIP files and download to the install folder</a></li>
  <li><a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm#02_unzip_files">Step 2: Unzip installation files in the correct sequence</a></li>
  <li><a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm#03_lm_container">Step 3: Run Configurator to configure Lifecycle Manager container</a></li>
  <li><a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm#04_start_lm_instance">Step 4: Start the Lifecycle Manager instance</a></li>
  <li><a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm#05_lm_install">Step 5: Install and configure the Akana Lifecycle Manager Application feature</a>. In this step, rather than creating a new database, you'll point to the database for your existing LM version.</li>
  <li><a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm#06_extract_client_zips">Step 6: Extract javaclients.zip file and specify the URL in the configuration settings</a></li>

  <li><a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm#08_lm_create_library">Step 8: Create a Lifecycle Manager Library</a></li>
</ol>

<a name="upgrade_80_802_03"></a><h5>Step 3: Verify that the upgrade was successful</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Review the log files for any error messages.</li>
  <li>Verify the upgrade by logging on to the Lifecycle Manager admin console:
    <ul>
      <li>http://{web.server.url.host}/{contextroot}/admin/mainMenu.do</li>
      <li>Verify that the Build number is <b>8.0.2.x</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<a name="upgrade_80_802_04"></a><h5>Step 4: Complete post-install checks</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Navigate to the LM /admin console, then verify and update any settings as appropriate.</li>
  <li>Optional: If desired, execute the following command that reset window size and location settings to the system defaults. Run this command via the LM /admin console &gt; Execute Command):
    <pre>Fully Qualified Command Class Name: ClearAllUserUIProperties
Library:[choose each library]
Click [Invoke]</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Have each user upgrade the Repository Client (if it's installed) with the new version.</li>
</ul>

<a name="lm_upgrade_71_80"></a><h3>Upgrading Lifecycle Manager from Version 7.1 to Version 8.0.0</h3>
<p>These upgrade instructions are for a scenario where you have Lifecycle Manager 7.1 installed and are upgrading <strong>from</strong> Lifecycle Manager 7.1 <strong>to</strong> Lifecycle Manager 8.0.0.</p>
<p>If you're installing Lifecycle Manager for the first time, refer to the <a href="../install/install_lm_v80x.htm">Lifecycle Manager 8.0  Installation Guide</a>.</p>
<p> If you're upgrading from a version earlier than 7.1, you'll first need to upgrade to 7.1.</p>
<p> If you are upgrading from 7.1, you can use any of the 7.1.x micro releases (including 7.1.6). Unlike the rule to sequentially iterate through the major or minor version releases, there's no need to do the same for the micro releases (such as 7.1.x). Each micro release includes all the incremental changes you'll need.</p>
<p>You can also refer to the Install and System Admin Docs for more general Lifecycle Manager information. Lifecycle Manager documentation is in either of two locations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the LM folder on the <a href="https://library.akana.com/display/MAIN/Downloads" title="Akana support site" target="_blank">Akana support site</a>. On the <strong>Downloads</strong> page, choose <strong>Lifecycle Manager</strong>. Choose the applicable version, and look in the <strong>Documentation</strong> subfolder.</li>
  <li>On the Akana documentation site: <a href="http://docs.akana.com/docs-test/lm/index.html" title="Akana docs site, LM section" target="_self">http://docs.akana.com/docs-test/lm/index.html</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upgrading from 7.1 to 8.0.0 includes the following steps:</p>

  <li><a href="#upgrade_71_80_01">Step 1: Pre-Install Instructions</a></li>
  <li><a href="#upgrade_71_80_02">Step 2: Install the upgrade</a></li>
  <li><a href="#upgrade_71_80_03">Step 3: Verify that the upgrade was successful</a></li>
  <li><a href="#upgrade_71_80_04">Step 4: Post-Install Instructions</a></li>
</ol>

<a name="upgrade_71_80_01"></a><h5>Step 1: Pre-Install Instructions</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Back up your database and the Lifecycle Manager 7.1 application home directory.
    <p>The LM 7.1 to 8.0 upgrade process is a migration to the LM 8.0 as a feature in the Akana Platform. You will follow the <a href="http://docs.akana.com/lm/install/install_lm_v80x.htm">Lifecycle Manager 8.0 install guide</a> up to the point of &quot;Step 5: Install and configure the Lifecycle Manager Feature&quot;; in this step, in the Database Wizard, you will choose to use an existing database. At this point, you will provide the relevant connection information to allow the connection to your existing database. You then continue with the steps from the Lifecycle Manager 8.0 install guide. For details, see <a href="#upgrade_71_80_02">Install the upgrade</a> below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Record your current 7.1 application settings. You can do this by noting down the LM /admin console's Settings page values, and/or use the following database query:
    <pre>select * from installprops;</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Verify that there is enough free disk space on the application server:
    <ul>
      <li>volume for {platform_home} directories: 1GB</li>
      <li>volume for /tmp directories:  500MB</li>
      <li>volume for logs during upgrade: 125MB</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Verify that there is enough available space on the database tablespaces for a data upgrade:
    <ul>
      <li>There should be at least 15% free space in each Lifecycle Manager tablespace.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Increase the number of application logs in your logging pool. Depending on the number of assets in your installation, the version 8.0 upgrade process doesn't contain any data upgrades, so there should be minimal log activity during the initial startup of the application. However, Akana typically recommends increasing the number of logs to at least 25. For details, refer to information about the Installation Admin command <strong>SetLoggingConfig</strong> in the Lifecycle Manager System Admin guide. After the upgrade, you can reset the number of logs in the pool to your steady-state operational level.</li>
  <li>App_%.log file locations when upgrading: as the LM 7.1 logging configuration is in the database, the LM app logs still persist in the pre-defined location (typically in <strong>[lm_home]/logs/webapp</strong>). Because of this, when installing Lifecycle Manager 8.0, the old LM 7.1 logging location directory must still exist, to ensure that any DataUpgrade entries are captured. After a successful upgrade, you can alter the logging configuration to adjust the location to the OSGi standard of <strong>[platform_home]/instances/[instance_name]/log</strong>.</li>
  <li>Conditional, certificate setup: When LM is using HTTPS (or is behind a front-facing device using HTTPS), and/or when LM needs to use LDAPS, or integrates with another system using certificates (such as the Akana API Platform), those certificates must be trusted by the Akana Platform JRE's default trust store  (<strong>{platform_home}/jre/lib/security/cacerts</strong>).

</ol>


<a name="upgrade_71_80_02"></a><h5>Step 2: Install the upgrade</h5>
<p>The only difference for the upgrade scenario is that when you're configuring the Lifecycle Manager feature for the database, you'll choose to use an existing database vs creating a new database. In the upgrade scenario, you'll point to your existing Lifecycle Manager 7.1 database.</p>
<p>The steps are summarized below:</p>
