<h3>Notation Used in this Document</h3>
<ul>
  <h3>Notation for the Configuration Parameters</h3>
  <p>Throughout this System Admin guide there will be references to configuration 
    parameters (see <a href="#config">The Configuration File</a>). 
    In this System Admin Guide these configuration settings are bracketed 
    with "{" and "}" to identify them and make it easier to search on and replace 
    these values. For example, app.server.host is the lib.conf variable, while 
    in the instructions below it is referred to as {app.server.host} 
</ul>    


<hr>
<h3><a name="adminaccounts">Administrator Accounts</a></h3>
<ul>
  <p>There are three different and distinct administrator roles that can 
    be assigned to user accounts within the application. All three roles are described here in 
    order to provide context for the Installation Administrator responsibilities 
    and required skills as described in this document.

    <dd>This <i>System Admin Guide</i> is written and intended for the 
        users assigned the role of Installation Administrator, also known as the <i>system administrator</i> for this 
        installation. See <a href="#adminlogin">System Admin Console</a> for information on the UI provided
        to Installation Administrators. The initial list of Installation Admins is set in the lib.conf file
        in the {admin.users} property. After the initial installation, the list is maintained
        by the existing Installation Administrators through use of the SetInstallationProperty
        command. See the section <a href="#installationproperties">Update Installation-wide Properties</a>
        for more details. <p>Responsibilities of the Installation Administrator generally include these types of activities: 
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>Coordinate installation of the base product and service packs with the underlying server sysadmins</p>
        <li> 
          <p>Creating the initial Asset Library and additional libraries as required </p>
        <li> 
          <p>Obtaining and reviewing system logs </p>

</ul>
<dl> 
  <dt><b>Library Administrator (also known as the Library Support Account)</b></dt>
</dl>
<ul>
  <dl> 
    <dd>Each Asset Library is created with a user account that is authorized 
      to all library administrative roles. This account is designated as the Library 
      Administrator or Library Support Account. 
      <p>Responsibilities generally include these types of activities: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>Managing the Library parameters that are configurable (post-Library 
            creation)</p>
        <li> 
          <p>Managing the Global Definition Template used for the library's Asset 
            definition </p>
        <li> 
          <p>Managing the Library's UDDI publishing</p>
      </ul>

<ul>
  <dl> 
    <dd>The Usage Controller role is assigned to someone in the library who works 
      to provide the necessary group structure, role assignment and template associations 
      to accommodate the processes established for asset production and consumption 
      activities. 
      <p>Each Library has one or more users assigned the role of Usage controller. 
      <p>The responsibilities generally include these types of activities: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>Create and manage the library group and project hierarchy</p>
        <li>

<h3><a name="adminlogin">Admin Console for the Installation Administrator</a></h3>
<h3>System Admin Console Access</h3>
<p>Portfolio Manager and Lifecycle Manager provide access to a number of administrative functions via the System 
  Admin Console. This application can be accessed from within a web 
  browser (from the top navigation bar item called <b>Administration</b> 
  that is available to users who are installation administrators) and also directly 
  by URL as follows. Replace the "/lm" in the examples with your context root, 
  as appropriate. The context root is "logiclibrary" for systems that are upgraded
  from Logidex.</p>
<ul>
  <li><pre>http://{web.server.url.host}/lm/admin/mainMenu.do</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>Login: anyone in {admin.users}</pre></li>
      <li><pre>Password: a password specific to the user in {admin.users} </pre> 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Super user access is only available from the following URL and is meant 
    to be used only when the standard LDAP accounts are not available 
    <ul>
      <li><pre>http://{web.server.url.host}/lm/application/access/suLogin.do</pre></li>
      <li><pre>Password: {superuser.password} </pre> </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<h3>System Admin Console Main Menu</h3>
<p>From the system admin console, the Installation Administrator can perform a 
  number of administrative tasks. Here are the items provided in the Main Menu:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p><b>Execute Command</b> - Selecting this item displays a page where you 
      can enter a command and the applicable command parameters.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> 
        <p>Some <a href="#admincmd">administration commands</a> are documented in this 
          document</p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>Other commands may be provided by SOA support on an 
          as-needed basis.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><b>Create New Library</b> - Click on this link to display the Create 
      Library page. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><b><a href="#ManageVAS">Manage Visible Asset Sources </a></b>- Selecting 
      this item and designating your library from the drop down list produces 
      a listing of the Visible Asset Sources that are available to your library. 
      A Visible Asset Source is a configuration that causes assets published from 
      an individual library's asset source to be simultaneously published into 
      your library as well. You can use Visible Asset Sources to create a &quot;federated&quot; 
      library configuration with other libraries both in your Portfolio/Lifecycle Manager installation 
      and from a remote Portfolio/Lifecycle Manager installation.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><b><a name="RemoteAssetSource"></a>Manage Remote Asset Sources </b>- Selecting 
      this item produces a listing of the Remote Asset Sources currently available 
      to your installation. A Remote Asset Source is a connection established 
      to a library that exists on an installation separate from your own. 
      Creating a Remote Asset Source results in the availability of the remote 
      library for the creation of a visible asset source for a library local to 
      your installation. See &quot;Manage Visible Asset Sources&quot; in the previous 
      bullet. A Remote Asset Source entry establishes connection information to 
      the remote library, as well as a polling interval for the update of published 
      asset information between systems. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><b>Browse Logs </b>- Click on this link to display the Application Logs page. On this page is a list of logs produced 
      , a means by which to email them to SOA Software support or any other recipient, and corresponding links to access the logs directly.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><b>Download Upgrades </b>- This link provides access to the Service 
      Center, where downloads are available to upgrade your installation.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><b>System Admin and Additional Documentation </b>- This link provides access 
      to the Service Center, where documentation (including this 
      System Administration Guide) is provided.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5><a name="ManageVAS"></a>Visible Asset Sources</h5>
<p>Each library consists of two components: the <i>library</i> itself, 
  which contains the published assets, and its associated <i>asset source, </i>where 
  assets are created and edited prior to being published. When assets are published 
  from an asset source into its associated library, you can also designate that 
  a simultaneous publish take place into other libraries as well. The configuration 
  necessary to cause this to take place occurs in the target library and consists 
  of the establishment of a Visible Asset Source for each source library desired. 
  Libraries that share content in this fashion are said to be &quot;federated&quot;. 
  Note that content shared in this manner can include reference models as well 
  as assets. Published assets are refreshed in all applicable libraries with each 
  publish from the originating asset source. In cases where the Visible Asset 
  Source entry uses a remote library, the update takes place according to the 
  polling interval established by the Remote Asset Source entry used by the Visible 
  Asset Source. </p>
<h5>Create a Visible Asset Source</h5>
<p>On the Manage Visible Asset Sources page, selecting your library from the Library 
  drop down list causes the page to refresh and display a list of all other libraries 
  existing for your installation. If you want to pull assets and models from a 
  visible library into your library, click on the corresponding <b>Selected</b> 
  box. As you do so, there are two important things to consider and choices to 
  make:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that you select a <b>Responsible User</b> that corresponds to a user 
    account in your library that is associated with the &quot;Reporting Group&quot; 
    you intend. The responsible user's reporting group will: 
    <ol>
      <li>Be used as the owning group for the assets from this asset source.</li>
      <li>Designate the publish template(s) to be used for the assets published 
        from this asset source. The publish template used for these assets can: 
        <ol>
          <li>Provide publish information, such as designation of private artifacts 
            and establishment of asset owner involvement in asset reuse approvals.</li>
          <li>Automatically establish forum topics for the assets' discussion 
            forums.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Note: the default &quot;Responsible User&quot; account is the account 
        called <i>Portfolio Manager</i> or <i>Lifecycle Manager</i>. This is a user account associated with 
        the application itself, not a human user. The 
        <i><a href="#SuperUser">Super user</a></i><a href="#SuperUser"> 
        account</a> is configured in your web browser application in a 
        fashion similar to other user accounts.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Establish a Classification Criteria Set to use as a stereotype in order 
    to filter the assets published from the Visible Asset Source. By naming a 
    classification criteria set, you cause only those assets that meet the classification 
    criteria of the named set to be included in the publish. Classification Criteria 
    Sets (CCSs) are created and managed by your library's Usage Controller(s) 
    through your web browser application.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the help system available online in the application 
  for more information on: Classification Criteria Sets, Publish Templates and 
  their association with groups and asset types, asset publish information, Reporting 
  Groups, and Reference Models.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="config">The Configuration File</a></h3>
<ul>
  <p>The configuration parameters for your installation are in <b><i>ApplicationRoot</i>/conf/lib.conf</b> 
  <p>This configuration file was created at install time and can be updated after 
    the install to enable new features, change settings, etc. Most of the configuration parameters can now
    be changed via the admin command SetInstallationProperty. See the <a href="#installationproperties">Update Installation-wide
    Properties</a> section of this document for details. For configuration points that cannot be set via the command, the lib.conf
    file can be edited directly using any text editor (such as vi, Emacs, etc.) from the UNIX 
    command line of the application server or with Wordpad on Windows Servers:</p>
  <li> 
    <p>Login to the app server as {logidex.user} </p>
  <li> 
    <p>Edit the lib.conf file <pre> vi <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/conf/lib.conf </pre> 
    </p>
  <li> 
    <p>Apply the changes (Note: if you deployed Portfolio Manager or Lifecycle Manager as an EAR file without using the SOA-supplied install scripts, 
    the following commands may not update the running application. Contact <a href="mailto:llsupport@soa.com">support</a> with any questions.<pre>
         <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/libctl stop
         <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/install update-config
         <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/libctl start </pre></p>
</ul>

<h3><a name="configdesigner">Configuration Designer</a></h3>
<ul>
   <p>The Eclipse-based Configuration Designer (CD) plug-in provides library administrators a rich client interface to 
      manage the configuration for their libraries. CD is included in the Repository Client--a standalone, Eclipse-based IDE--or
      the plug-in may be installed into an existing Eclipse IDE. See the Download Center in your library for installation details. Once installed,
      administrators create one or more CD projects where each contains the configuration for a library. The following table outlines common 
      administrative functions and the project file(s) associated with that function.
   <table border="1">
   
    <tr> 
      <td><b>Configuration Function</b></td>

<h3><a name="ldap">Setting up LDAP</a></h3>
<ul>
<p>All of the configuration parameters needed to setup Portfolio Manager or Lifecycle Manager against a preexisting LDAP server or a new server are in the <a href="#config">
configuration file</a>.

<p>There are two distinct modes Portfolio Manager or Lifecycle Manager can operate in with respect to an LDAP server: native and guest mode.  
The first step in setting up the application to use an LDAP server is to determine which of these modes to use.
<ul>
<li><b>guest</b>: Guest mode provides a company the ability to configure the application against a preexisting LDAP server.  Most likely the LDAP
server will already have a set of users in the directory.  Portfolio Manager or Manager Lifecycle Manager will only use this LDAP server to search for users and 
authenticate them.  It will not perform any updates to the directory.

<li><b>native</b>: In this mode we assume that an existing LDAP server is not available.  In this case you can install an OpenLDAP server 
(freely downloadable) and configure Portfolio Manager or Lifecycle Manager to use it.  Management of users in the LDAP server is transparently done through the 
library pages.  See the installation guide on how to install OpenLDAP.
</ul>

<p>The following parameters describe how to configure the installation properties.  In most cases the defaults will be acceptable.  However:
if you plan to use 'guest' mode, then you will need to know a few details about your existing LDAP server.  Each property is described differently
depending on what mode is configured. See also the <a href="#installationproperties">Installation Properties</a> section.

<ul>
<p><li>
ldap.ownership.mode: Either set to 'native' or 'guest' as described above

<p><li>
ldap.binddn: This is the LDAP Distinguished Name if the LDAP server requires authentication to perform searches or modify entries. 
<br>
      <b>Guest</b>: Set this to the distinguished name of such a user, if required. 
      <br>
      <b>Native</b>: This does not need to be set as a default
      value of "cn=Manager,ou=People,dc=Logidex" will be used. 
      <p><li>
ldap.bindpassword: This only needs to be set if the ldap.binddn property is set.  The bind password is the password associated with the distinguished name, described above.  
<br>
      <b>Guest</b>: If ldap.binddn is set, set this to the associated password, 
      otherwise leave blank. <br>
      <b>Native</b>: This does not need to be set as a default 
      value of whatever logidex.password is set to will be used. You can however set this to 
      a different value for security purposes. 
      <p><li>
ldap.follow.referrals: Either set to 'true' or 'false'.  LDAP referrals are a way of directing LDAP actions to other servers in the event 
the target does not have the information requested.  Following referrals requires additional connection overhead and is only recommended 
if you know that your company uses referrals.
<br>
      <b>Guest</b>: Only set this to true if you require the ability to find users 
      located on different LDAP servers. <br>
      <b>Native</b>: This does not need to be set as a default 
      value of false will be used. Setting this to true will only incur a performance penalty. 
      <p><li>
ldap.url: This is a LDAP URL which conforms to <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2255.txt">RFC2255</a>, with the ability to specify 'ldaps' as a protocol.
This URL has two main purposes, first it specifies what host the LDAP server is on.  Secondly, the URL contains information on how to find users.
The URL is broken into several parts: protocol, hostname, port, base distinguished name(DN), attributes, search scope, filter, and extensions.  
At a minimum a hostname and base DN must be specified.  Other parameters may be necessary depending on your configuration.  The URL takes the format:
protocol://hostname:port/baseDN?attributes?scope?filter?extensions.  An example would look like (ldap://localhost:389/ou=People,dc=Logidex?uid?one??).  
Trailing question marks may be omitted.  
<br>
      <b>Guest</b>: This is highly dependent on the LDAP schema, configuration, 
      and company setup. Read through the following set of configuration points 
      to determine how to set up this property. <br>
      <b>Native</b>: This should not need to be set as a default 
      value of 'ldap://localhost:389/ou=People,dc=Logidex?uid?one??' will be used. See the 
      examples below to change the port number OpenLDAP runs on. 
      <ul>
<p><li>
protocol:  This can be set either to 'ldap' or 'ldaps'.  If set to 'ldap' all ldap communications will be sent unencrypted.  If the protocol is 
'ldaps' then communications will be done with TLS/SSL 3.0.  This requires setting up certificates on the LDAP server and configuring the 
application server as well, which is beyond the scope of this section.

<p><li>
hostname:  This can either be the hostname (preferred) or an IP of the LDAP server.

<p><li>
port:  If the port is not specified, it will default to 389 for ldap, and 636 for ldaps.

<p><li>
base DN:  This is the distinguished name of where to start LDAP searches.  To enhance performance, you should set this as deep as possible in the 
LDAP Directory Information Tree to maintain the smallest set of users you want to be visible.

<p><li>
attributes:  This is a comma separated list of LDAP attributes.  Only one attribute should be supplied here.  If it is omitted, then a default attribute
of 'uid' will be used.  This is the attribute used to look up users based on a login name.  Most commonly used to distinguish users are the 
'cn' (common name) or 'uid' (user id) attribute.  The distinguished names of the users will probably determine what to specify here.  For example, 
if most of the users in the LDAP directory look like 'cn=John Doe, ou=unit, dc=...' then you should specify 'cn' as the attribute to use to search.
Note: if more than one entry for a given user exists (even though they may logically refer to the same entity), authentication will be denied
as it does not know which to use. 

<p>
        <li> search scope: This can take one of three values: 'base', 'one', or 
          'sub'. The scope determines how to should search the entries in 
          the LDAP server trying to find a user. Base simply means only search 
          the entry referred to in the base DN. Since this never returns more 
          than one result it should never be used. A value of 'one' means only 
          search the direct descendants of the base DN. A value of 'sub' signifies 
          that the base DN along with all the subordinates of the base DN should 
          be searched. The default used if a scope is not specified is 'one'. 
          <p><li>
filter: This is an LDAP filter used to limit the number of users allowed access.  A user is only allowed access if they meet the 
previous requirements to login, plus pass the filter.  LDAP filters are rather complex and not discussed here.  As an example, specifying: 
'(employeeNumber=*)' would only allow users that have an employee number in their LDAP entry to login.  Before limiting users this way, make sure you 
successfully configure authentication against LDAP without filters, only then should you use the filtering mechanism.

<p><li>
extensions: Extensions are not used at this time.  This field will most likely be blank.
</ul>

</ul>
<p>If any of the following characters appears as part of the name or value of an RDN they must be escaped with a backslash:
<pre>, + " \ &lt; &gt; ;</pre>
<p>Also, due to fact that the lib.conf also interprets backslashes, one must double escape any backslashes.
For example: ldap.binddn=cn=John Doe\\, Jr.,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com


<p><b>ldap.url - LDAP server notes and examples:</b>
<dl>

<dt><i>OpenLDAP - native mode</i> - <font color="#000080">ldap://localhost:1234/ou=People,dc=Logidex?uid?one</font><br>
<dd>This URL should only be used if in native mode.  It simply uses port 1234 instead of the default.<br>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><i>Windows Domain Controller</i> - 
<dd><font color="#000080">ldap.url=ldap://windows-dc.example.com/CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com?sAMAccountName?one??</font><br>
<dd>One of the following
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#000080">ldap.binddn=CN=<i>normaluser</i>,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com</font> (LDAP format)<br>
    <li><font color="#000080">ldap.binddn=<i>normaluser</i>@example.com</font> (Windows 2000 and later account format)<br>
    <li><font color="#000080">ldap.binddn=example\\<i>normaluser</i></font> (pre-Windows 2000 account format, note the double '\')<br>
  </ul>
<dd><font color="#000080">ldap.bindpassword=<i>password</i></font><br>
<dd>This is the format used to connect to a Windows Domain Controller for authentication.  
The hostname is that of the domain controller.  
The base DN (CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com) is obtained taking 'CN=Users' and appending each component of the domain beginning with 'DC='.
The attribute (sAMAccountName) is the Windows Active Directory (LDAP) attribute used for authentication.  
Another possibility includes using the common name attribute: 'cn'.  
The ldap.binddn for Windows AD is simply a named user prepended with 'CN=' and appended with the binddn.  
The ldap.bindpassword is simply the password the user associated with ldap.binddn uses to login to Windows.  The user and password should be a user with minimal privileges and one that isn't normally associated with a human.
You can use the Windows Active Directory management console to determine the actual DN and attribute for authentication.<br>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><i>SunONE/iPlanet Directory Server</i> - <font color="#000080">ldap.url=ldap://iplanetserver.example.com/OU=People,DC=example,DC=com?uid?one</font><br>
<dd>In this example, the LDAP server is located on a host called iplanetserver.example.com, running on the default port of 389.  
The base DN (OU=people,DC=example,DC=com) is obtained by taking 'OU=People' and appending each component of the domain beginning with 'DC='.
The attribute (uid) is what the iPlanet Directory Server uses as the default identifier.  
You can use the administrative console to determine the exact DN and attribute.
Depending on the setup, you may have to specify an ldap.binddn and ldap.bindpassword if the LDAP server is not setup for anonymous searching.<br>&nbsp;</dd>

<h3><a name="ldapssl">Setting up LDAP over SSL</a></h3>
<ul>
  <p>It is best to make sure the installation works without SSL first, then turn 
    on SSL after you have verified that all the configuration parameters are set 
    correctly. The steps to setup LDAP over SSL are as follows and will depend 
    on the type of LDAP and application server you have installed. 
  <p> 
  <ol>
    <li>Configure and setup the LDAP server with a certificate to use for SSL 
    <li>Export the certificate and save it in DER format (other formats may work). 
    <li>Import the certificate into the keystore for the JDK the application server 
      is using 
    <li>Update the lib.conf file by changing the ldap.url to ldaps://servername:636/... 
      <br>
      Run <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/install update-config 
    <li>Restart the Application server's JVM 
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here is a step-by-step example for Novell eDirectory and WebLogic:</p>
  <li>Configure and setup the LDAP server with a certificate to use for SSL 
    <ul>
      <li>In ConsoleOne (NDS's admin console), click on the LDAP container in 
        the left nav tree that contains the server you wish to use SSL for. The 
        right side should contain an "LDAP Server - servername" entry 
      <li>Right click in the right hand pane (somewhere in the unused space) and 
        select New -&gt; Object; select "NDSPKI:Key Material" 
      <li>Step through the wizard, the defaults should be good enough, but ensure 
        the server is correct. Give it a meaningful name like "LDAP SSL". 
      <li>Right click on the "LDAP Server" entry and select properties. 
      <li>Select the SSL/TLS Configuration tab 
      <li>For the server certificate select the SSL certificate you just created 
        and change any options you'd like. 
      <li>Select OK 
    </ul>
  <li>Export the certificate and save it in DER format (other formats may work). 
    <ul>
      <li>Right click on the certificate you just created (e.g. "LDAP SSL - ldapserver") 
        and select properties 
      <li>Click the Certificates tab and make sure the tab's dropdown has the 
        "Trusted Root Certificate" selected, and then select Export 
      <li>Export the certificate in DER format 
    </ul>
  <li>Import the certificate into the keystore for the JDK the application server 
    is using 
    <ul>
      <li>Login to the application server (repeat for each server in the cluster 
        if applicable) 
      <li>Copy the exported certificate from above to the machine 
      <li>Add the key to the java keystore using the keytool command, e.g.: <br>
        $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -import -v -alias NDSSSL -file /tmp/TrustedRootCert.der 
        -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts 
    </ul>
  <li>Update the lib.conf file 
    <ul>
      <li><i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/libctl stop appserver 
      <li>Change ldap.url to use SSL - ldap.url=ldaps://... 
      <li>install update-config 
      <li><i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/libctl start appserver 
    </ul>
  <li>Restart the App Server's JVM 
    <ul>
      <li>stop WebLogic 
      <li>start WebLogic 
    </ul>

<h3><a name="usessl">Setting up SSL</a></h3>
<ul>
<p>Portfolio Manager and Lifecycle Manager support the use of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption.  However, 
by default, the installation is not configured to use SSL.  If you want to use SSL for your installation,
you will need to modify the default configuration.  Changes are required on both the Web Server and the App Server.
<h6>Update the Web Server</h6>
<p>These updates are for an Apache web server.
<ol>
<li>Login to the web server as root.
<li>Create and Install SSL Certificates<br>
    If you will be using SSL on your web server,  you will need to request your digital certificates 
    from a certificate authority (CA), or you can self-sign the certificate. Below are instructions 
    from two CAs - Verisign and GeoTrust (formerly Equifax) on requesting a certificate:
    <br><a href="http://www.verisign.com/support/csr/apache/v00.html">
    http://www.verisign.com/support/csr/apache/v00.html</a>
    <br><a href="http://www.geotrust.com/quickssl/install/index.htm">
    http://www.geotrust.com/quickssl/install/index.htm</a>
    <p><b>NOTE</b> - the SSL certificate host name must match the {web.server.host} property in the
    <a href="#config">lib.conf</a> file.
    <p>  
<li>Copy the certificate, key, and CA file (if applicable) to:
<pre>
  <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/httpd/conf/your_company.com.crt
  <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/httpd/conf/your_company.com.key
  <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/httpd/conf/some_CA.crt
</pre>
<li>Modify the Apache configuration to add a SSL virtual host:
<pre>
  $ vi /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf  (or any editor) 
  
  &lt;IfDefine HAVE_SSL&gt;
  &lt;VirtualHost _default_:443&gt;
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL
    
    SSLCertificateFile conf/your_company.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile conf/your_company.key
    SSLCACertificateFile conf/some_CA.crt         
    SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" \
         nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
         downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
  &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
  &lt;/IfDefine&gt;
                 
  Add the above section and update the lines for the SSL certificates to refer
  to the certificate, key, and CA files from above
</pre>
<li>Modify the automatic startup shell script
<pre>
  Solaris
    vi <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/httpd/bin/apache-init.d
    
    Change "$CONTROL start" to "$CONTROL startssl"
</pre>

<li>Restart Apache

<h3><a name="logs">Log Files and Logging Levels</a></h3>
<h5>Log files and location</h5>
  <p>Below is a brief description of the most important log files (not all of 
    the log files are listed here). 
  <p>By default the log files are in the directory <i><i>ApplicationRoot</i>/logs</i>, with 
    subdirectories (listed below) for each major component. 
  <ul>
    <li><b>webapp</b> 
      <dl> 
        <dt>app_N.log
        <dd>This log file will contain a history of the transactions that have 
          gone thru the Portfolio Manager or Lifecycle Manager library. 
        <dt>incident_NN.log 
        <dd>This log file is used to capture error exceptions (called incidents) 
          that are generated in the library. In almost all cases, this 
          log will contain lower level detail that will pinpoint the cause of 
          the problem. It may be necessary to call the SOA Software support team 
          to interpret this log file. 
        <dt>startwl-$date.log and stopwl-$date.log <b>(WebLogic)</b> 
        <dd>This log captures stdout when using libctl to start WebLogic. 
        <dt>startjboss-$date.log<b>(JBoss)</b> 
        <dd>This log captures stdout when using libctl to start JBoss. 
      </dl>
    <li><b>appserv</b> 
      <dl> 
        <dt> 
        <dd>The appserv directory provides a great deal of detail about the operational 
          aspects of the application server product itself. It provides useful 
          information to verify that the server has started correctly and with 
          the correct parameters. There may be times when there is additional 
          information in this log that will be needed for debugging. This directory 
          should be a symlink to the application server's logging directory. 
      </dl>
  </ul>
  <h5>Changing the logging levels</h5>
  The logging level may be changed dynamically at runtime through the 
  Administration console. See the <a href="#admincmd">Admin Console Commands</a> 
  section for information on how to update or view the current logging configuration. 
  <p>Sample Logging file: 
  <table border="0">
    <tr> 
      <td> 
        <pre>
.level=INFO
com.logiclibrary.level=INFO

handlers=com.logiclibrary.common.logging.ThreadFileHandler, com.logiclibrary.common.logging.IncidentHandler

com.logiclibrary.common.logging.IncidentHandler.count=10
com.logiclibrary.common.logging.IncidentHandler.limit=1000000
com.logiclibrary.common.logging.IncidentHandler.pattern=/opt/lm/logs/webapp/incident_%g.log

com.logiclibrary.common.logging.ThreadFileHandler.count=10
com.logiclibrary.common.logging.ThreadFileHandler.limit=5000000
com.logiclibrary.common.logging.ThreadFileHandler.pattern=/opt/lm/logs/webapp/lm_%g.log

com.logiclibrary.common.logging.FileHandler.pattern=/opt/lm/logs/webapp/lm_%g.log
</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  The only parameters that should need to be changed are the pathnames where the 
  log files are placed and the logging level. The *.pattern properties specify 
  where to place individual log files and how to number them; the %g is replaced 
  with a sequential number. Once a log reaches the limit (*.limit property) the 
  log number is increased. Once the log number reaches the *.count property the 
  count is reverted to 0 and overwrites any previous log file with that name. 
  <p>Possible logging levels are as follows (from most verbose to no logging): 
  <ul>
    <li>ALL 
    <li>FINEST 
    <li>FINER                         
    <li>FINE 
    <li>CONFIG 
    <li>INFO 
    <li>WARNING 
    <li>SEVERE 
    <li>OFF 
  </ul>
  <p>The default level for new installations is <b>FINER</b>, and can be changed to <b>ALL or 
    FINEST</b> to get more detailed debugging information. 
  <p>NOTE: Setting the logging level to one of the more "verbose" levels will 
    tend to slow down the performance of the application so you should only turn 
    up the logging if needed for debugging. 
  <hr>
  <h3><a name="dba">Database Administration</a></h3>
  <ul>
    <p>Database administration is not covered here. Generally DBA responsibilities 
      are a separate and specialized responsibility. 
    <p>There are no additional DBA requirements for Portfolio Manager or Lifecycle Manager. 
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3><a name="backup">Backing up and Restoring the Application and Data</a></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Full Installation Backup (code and data):</b> 
      <ul>
        <p>In some cases you will want to do a full backup of the installation, 
          including data, code, and configuration information. 
        <p>Prior to installing service packs you should do an installation backup. 
          Most service packs will be simple code updates, however there may be 
          times when a data update in a service pack is required to support new 
          function. 
        <p>Here is a list of the items that should be backed up: 
        <ol>
          <li><i>ApplicationRoot</i><br>
            <b>Note - make sure you backup so that the file and directory permissions 
            and ownership and symbolic links are preserved</b> 
            <ul>
              <b>Example backup command using the tar command</b> <br>
              (you can use any backup/restore tool or utility, this is an example 
              of one option) 
              <li>login to the app server as root 
              <li>su - {logidex.user} 
              <li>cd <i>ApplicationRoot</i> 
              <li>tar cvpf /tmp/lm-backup.tar . 
            </ul>
          <li>The Database 
        </ol>
        <p>NOTE - this does not backup other pre-requisite installed products, 
          such as the app server (WebLogic, WebSphere, etc), database products 
          (Oracle, UDB, etc), or web server products. You should backup those 
          products according to the procedures outlined by those vendors. 
      </ul>
      <br>
    <li><b>Data Backup Only:</b> 
      <ul>
        <p>Your data is stored in the database, so 
          only the database tables spaces need to be backed up when you are backing 
          up data. 
        <ol>
          <li>Database users information 
          <li>Database tablespaces 
            <p>By default these tablespaces are named <i>DBUSER</i>DATA, <i>DBUSER</i>LONG, 
              <i>DBUSER</i>INDX, and <i>DBUSER</i>TEMP, unless you overrode the tablespace 
              names in the <a href="#config">lib.conf</a> file. 
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <br>
    <li><b>Full Installation Restore (code and data)</b> 
      <ul>
        <p>If you ever have the need to do a full restore of Portfolio Manager or Lifecycle Manager 
          and the corresponding data, follow these steps: 
        <ol>
          <li>Stop the app server, web server, and authorization server 
            <ul>
              <li><i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/libctl stop appserver 
            </ul>
          <li>Restore the database from the last good backup copy 
          <li>Restore the <i>ApplicationRoot</i> tree from the last good backup<br>
            <b>Note - make sure you restore so that that the file and directory 
            permissions and ownership and symbolic links are also restored</b> 
            <ul>
              <b>Example restore command using the tar command</b> <br>
              (you can use any backup/restore tool or utility, this is an example 
              of one option) 
              <li>login to the app server as root 
              <li>su - {logidex.user} 
              <li>cd <i>ApplicationRoot</i> 
              <li>tar xvpf /tmp/lm-backup.tar 
            </ul>
          <li><i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/install upgrade 
          <li><i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/libctl start appserver 
          <li>Restart the web server

  <h3><a name="libraryuser">Adding a Library User</a></h3>
  <ul>
    <p>If {ldap.ownership.mode}=guest, user information is obtained from 
      the external LDAP server. Therefore, there is no concept of creating users 
      from within the application. Valid LDAP users can simply login to the library to either 
      request access from the usage controller or be allowed in, depending if 
      controlled access is turned on or not. 
    <p>If {ldap.ownership.mode}=native, users request accounts from the "Request 
      an Account" link off the login page. Their entry is dependent on whether 
      controlled access for a library is turned on or not. </p>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="resetuserpw">Reset a User Password</a></h3>
  <ul>
    <p>A user can reset a password using the "Forgot Password" link on the login 
      page.
    <p><b>NOTE: </b> if {ldap.ownership.mode}=guest, then password resets must 
      be done through the external LDAP server.

<h3><a name="SuperUser">Super User</a> <a></a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Portfolio Manager or Lifecycle Manager provide the capability of accessing your libraries and your System 
    Admin console by logging in with a special &quot;user&quot; account that does 
    not require authentication by your LDAP system. This account, termed the &quot;Super 
    User&quot; account can be used via the web browser application to 
    access your library and the System Admin console. Logging in as Super User 
    provides you with unlimited access to the libraries of your installation and 
    the facilities provided by the System Admin console. Note that super user 
    access can be enabled or disabled in the <a href="#config">lib.conf</a> 
    file by assigning a password or leaving the password blank.</p>
  <h5>The Purpose of Super User</h5>
  <p>Super User access is provided to enable you to recover from the lack of an 
    active Library Administrator account. By logging into a library 
    as super user, you can activate an inactive account 
    or create a new user account and assign the Library Administrator role.</p>
  <p>Another purpose for the Super User account is to provide you with a user 
    account that is portrayed as being associated with the application 
    as opposed to being associated with an individual, human user. Portfolio Manager or Lifecycle Manager provides
    for the use of the super user account as an &quot;application user&quot; called 
    <i>Portfolio Manager Application User</i> or <i>Lifecycle Manager Application User</i>. This user is available for 
    such things as being recorded as the &quot;submitter&quot; of assets submitted 
    by automation and being identified as the &quot;responsible user&quot; 
    when establishing library federation through creation of <a href="#ManageVAS">Visible 
    Asset Source</a> and <a href="#RemoteAssetSource">Remote Asset Source</a> 
    configuration.</p>
  <h5> Super User Role Assignments</h5>
  <p>The Super User account is assigned the library roles 
    of Library Administrator, Usage Controller and Asset User. In addition, this 
    account is also assigned the group roles of Asset Capture Engineer (ACE), 
    Publisher and Asset Owner - all at the Enterprise Group level. See the 
    web browser application's online help for more information on roles 
    and their scope of application.</p>

    <a name="multilibraries">Creating Additional Libraries</a></h3>
  <ul>
    <p>If your installation needs to create multiple Asset Libraries, you can 
      create them as needed. Additional libraries can be created using via the 
      <a href="#adminlogin">Admin Console for the Installation Administrator</a>.

  <h3><a name="downloaduploadassets">Download assets or upload assets automatically</a></h3>
  <ul>
    <p> The ability to automate asset operations is provided by the Automation 
      Extensions (AE). There are two samples provided with the AE that allow a 
      user to import a group of assets into a library or export a group of assets 
      from a library. See the SampleLoader and SampleDownloader in the AE installable 
      and accompanying documentation available from the support link off the top

  <h3><a name="installcmd">The Install Command</a></h3>
  <ul>
    <p>The install command is used for both the initial install of Portfolio Manager / Lifecycle Manager, 
      and also for installing upgrades, such as service packs and new releases. 
      Below is a description of the command options: 
    <p> 
    <ul>
      <li><b>update-config</b> <br>
        The "update-config" option should be used to propagate changes if lib.conf 
        has been edited. 
        <p> 
      <li><b>upgrade</b> <br>
        The "upgrade" option should be used for installing service packs and new 
        releases. 
        <p> 
      <li><b>install</b> <br>
        The "install" option should only be used for the initial install. 
        It must be run after the "dbsetup" option for WebLogic and JBoss, and 
        after "dbsetup" and "setup-websphere" for WebSphere. 
        <p> 
      <li><b>dbsetup</b> <br>
        The "dbsetup" option creates an SQL command file in <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin 
        that must be executed on the database server before the rest of the install 
        can proceed. 
        <p> 
      <li><b>setup-websphere</b> <br>
        The "setup-websphere" option is used to create a script specific to WebSphere 
        (called <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/websphere.setup) for setting up the WebSphere 
        application components needed to install the application. 
        <p>

  <h3><a name="admincmd">Commands You Can Run From The Admin Console</a></h3>
  <ul>
    <p>There are several special administrative and library maintenance commands

<h3><a name="attributedefinitions">Customize user attributes and LDAP 
  attributes</a></h3>
<ul>
  <p>The user properties that appear in the create and display user and contact 
    pages are obtained and configured through the attribute definitions. 
    Attribute definitions determine not only the names of fields that are available 
    and displayed for users, but also the corresponding services to 
    use when looking up user information. This is accomplished by configuring 
    an XML document and uploading it through the Admin Console using the 
    <a href="#admincmd">Attribute Definition</a> commands: GetAttributeDefinitionSchema, 
    GetCurrentAttributeDefinitions, GetDefaultAttributeDefinitions, and SetAttributeDefinitions. 
  <p>The following is an example document. 
  <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;ContactAttributeDefinitions xmlns="http://www.logiclibrary.com/2004/ContactAttributesXML"&gt;
        &lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Full Name" include-in-filter="true" include-in-list="true"&gt;
    &lt;ExternalSourceMapping source-id="LDAP" name-in-source="cn" /&gt;
  &lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
  &lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Email" include-in-filter="true" include-in-list="true"&gt;
    &lt;ExternalSourceMapping source-id="LDAP" name-in-source="mail" /&gt;
  &lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
        &lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="First Name" include-in-filter="false" include-in-list="false"&gt;
    &lt;ExternalSourceMapping source-id="LDAP" name-in-source="givenName" /&gt;
  &lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
        &lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Last Name" include-in-filter="false" include-in-list="false"&gt;
    &lt;ExternalSourceMapping source-id="LDAP" name-in-source="sn" /&gt;
  &lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
  &lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Phone" include-in-filter="false" include-in-list="true"&gt;&lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
  &lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Fax" include-in-filter="false" include-in-list="false"&gt;&lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
  &lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Cell" include-in-filter="false" include-in-list="false"&gt;&lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
&lt;/ContactAttributeDefinitions&gt;
</pre>
  <p>Each AttributeDefinition element defines a user attribute that may be displayed 
    (through the attribute-name XML attribute). The "Full Name" and 
    "Email" attributes are the only ones required.
  <p>If the include-in-filter XML attribute is set to true, the attribute is searchable 
    in user create and list pages, otherwise it is not. 
  <p>The include-in-list XML attribute is currently ignored, and all attributes 
    will show up in user detail pages. 
  <p>The ExternalSourceMapping element determines which user attributes come from 
    external sources through the source-id XML attribute. Currently only "LDAP" 
    is supported, which signifies that LDAP is queried, and which LDAP element 
    is used (name-in-source attribute), for user information related to that particular 
    user attribute. If there is no associated ExternalSourceMapping element configured, 
    then a Usage Controller can set that particular user attribute in the library. 
    A user can also set any such attributes for their own account. 
  <p>The sample Attribute Definition document configures 7 possible attributes 
    for a user (Full Name, Email, First Name, Last Name, Phone, Fax, and Cell). 
    The sample document also states where the user attribute values should come 
    from in LDAP. In this case, the "Full Name" for a user comes from the LDAP 
    "cn" attribute, the "Email" for a user comes from the LDAP "mail" attribute, 
    and so on. The "Full Name" and "Email" attributes are the only searchable 
    attributes. 
  <p>One attribute that may be helpful to include is the account name of a user. 
    This may be configured by adding the following entry to the XML file and editing 
    the name-in-source attribute to correspond with the attribute you are using 
    to authenticate users through LDAP (the attribute configured in the ldap.url 
    parameter in the lib.conf file): 
  <pre>
        &lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Account Name" include-in-filter="true" include-in-list="false"&gt;
    &lt;ExternalSourceMapping source-id="LDAP" name-in-source="uid" /&gt;
  &lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;

<h3><a name="artifactsearch">Full-text artifact search</a></h3>
  <h3>Full-text artifact search on Oracle</h3>  
  By default, new Lifecycle and Portfolio Manager installations perform full-text searching of asset artifacts on Oracle.  However if you've upgraded
  from RM 6.4, and had not yet enabled Full-text artifact searching on Oracle, perform the following steps:<br><br>
  Run the following to enable all asset queries to search for search terms within asset artifacts. <b>See also the installation property "database_text_enabled"
  in this document.</b> Note that there will be changes made to the database so the JDBC database user must have full privileges during this procedure.
  <ol>
     <li>Install Oracle Text.  This may have already been installed into the Oracle instance when it was created.  
       However if it was not you'll need to install it and ensure the default Oracle Text entities are installed.
       <ul>
         <li>The ORACLE_HOME/ctx/admin/defaults/drdef<i>lang</i>.sql script ensures the default stoplist, lexer, and wordlist are setup for your language.
             You'll need to run this script if these are not setup in the Oracle instance.
       </ul>
     </li>
    <li>On the Lifecycle Manager Server, from the Installation Admin Console:
      <ul>
        <li>Execute Command
        <li>Command name: EnableTextSearchOnOracle
        <li>Choose the desired library from the dropdown list
        <li>Invoke
        <li>Several confirmation messages are output
        <li>Repeat for each library where full text searching is desired
      </ul>
        If an error is generated such as:<br>
        "PLS-00201: identifier 'CTX_DDL' must be declared<br>
        ORA-06550: line 1, column 7:<br>
        PL/SQL: Statement ignored" <br>
        Have your DBA execute this SQL query: <br>
        GRANT CTXAPP TO <i>yourDBuser</i><br>
        Then re-run the command above.

    <li>On the database, execute the GRANT statements output from the command above. These are listed here:
        <ul>--Change "dbuser" to the database user name in your environment.<br>
        GRANT EXECUTE ON CTX_CLS TO <i>dbuser</i>;<br>
        GRANT EXECUTE ON CTX_DDL TO <i>dbuser</i>;<br>

        GRANT EXECUTE ON CTX_THES TO <i>dbuser</i>;<br>
        
        </ul>

   After successful command completion, set the installation property "database_text_enabled" to true so new libraries are automatically indexed.

  <h3>Full-text artifact search on SQL Server</h3>  
  <p>Full-text searching is enabled by default on SQL Server.  
  However SQL Server only "knows" how to index certain types of artifacts depending on which filters are installed.

<h3><a name="installationproperties">Update Installation-wide Properties</a></h3>
<ul>
  <p>Most of the configuration values that are set through the lib.conf 
     (logidex.conf) during the initial installation can be updated through the UI via the Installation Administration command
     <a href="#admincmdinstallation">SetInstallationProperty</a>. This command works by manipulating override values that are stored in a database table. If no
     value has been set via SetInstallationProperty, or if a blank value is set, then the system uses values from the deployment
     descriptor--built from the 'conf' file properties--as was the case in previous releases. Use "GetInstallationProperty" 
     to view a property value as set in the configuration file and the value persisted in the database, if it exists. Take care to 
     not misconfigure properties that could lock you out of the system (e.g. LDAP parameters). The following table describes the 
     properties that can and cannot be set by this method.

<h3><a name="sso">Single Sign-on (SSO) Installation and Configuration</a></h3>
<ul>
  <p>Single Sign-on (SSO) is a login mechanism that allows authorization by an 
    external web server plug-in. This enables you to integrate with your 
    own "single sign on" solution. 
  <p>This capability is enabled by configuring the following property in the <a href="#config">lib.conf</a>. 
    <pre> userIdHeader= </pre> 
  <p>The value of this entry should specify the HTTP header name that 
    contains the authenticated user's user id (account name).
    So, for example if the lib.conf specifies "XYZ_USERID", 
    the logon logic will look for a HTTP Header
    with that name. Effectively, you enable external authorization by specifying 
    non-null values for this entry. 
  <p>If incoming HTTP request contains the specified header, the login 
    logic assumes that this user has been authenticated externally and does not 
    present a login challenge page. Instead, it attempts to find an existing User 
    object with the account name specified by the configured user id header.
    It then uses the 
    found User object to establish a session for the user. 
  <p>When properly configured and integrated with an external authentication mechanism, 
    users never see the login challenge. Instead they see the challenge 
    presented by the external authentication mechanism. In this mode it is not 
    necessary for Usage Controllers to define new users. 
    <p>When external authorization is configured, No "Logout" link appears on 
      the top navigation bar. 
  <p>The following resources should not be protected from SSO authorization:
    <ul>
      <li><i>contextroot</i>/application/access
      <li><i>contextroot</i>/ServerInfo
      <li><i>contextroot</i>/services
      <li><i>contextroot</i>/servlet/BirtReportServlet
      <li><i>contextroot</i>/servlet/WSDLResourceServlet
    </ul>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="topbanner">Customize the Web Page Branding Image (Top Banner)</a></h3>
<ul>
  <p>You can customize the banner on the top of all web pages with your 
    own branding information. This configuration is global 
    , which means it will be in effect for all libraries on your installation. 
  <p><b>Note</b>: The styles in this document may override the global 
    defaults. For example, the style sheet entry "<tt>A:hover { COLOR: #FFFFFF; 
    TEXT-DECORATION: underline; }</tt>" will override the hover link color for 
    the whole page. 
  <p> 
  <ol>
    <li>Create an image file for your banner<br>
      If you want to have your own banner, you need to supply an image file. The 
      image file can be any image format accepted by html (e.g. .gif, .jpeg, .png, 
      etc). Store the image file in the <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/customer/logidex.war/custom 
      directory (e.g. <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/customer/logidex.war/custom/MyBrand.gif) 
    <li>Create (or update) the custom.css file<br>
      The brand banner is configured via a cascading style sheet (.css) located 
      at - <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/customer/logidex.war/custom/custom.css If the file does 
      not exist, you can create the file using the options and values and the 
      example .css file below. Once the custom.css file is modified, you can deploy 
      the changes by running an upgrade: <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/libctl 
      stop appserver <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/install upgrade <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/libctl 
      start appserver 
      <p>There are many references to .css files in the internet. Here is one 
        web site that has information on general .css topics <a HREF="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/">http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/</a> 
        and a page of color references <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/color-background/background-color.html">http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/color-background/background-color.html</a> 
      <p>Basic Options and Values:<br>
      <b>#brand</b><br>
        These sections apply to the background and image file (.gif, .jpeg, etc) for the
        top banner (header)
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li><b>height:</b> this value should be chosen to accommodate the actual size 
      of the image (a height not greater than 50 px is recommended).</li>
    <li><b>background-image: URL("path-to/imagefile")</b> where the path/imagefile 
      is relative to the <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/customer/logidex.war/custom directory</li>
    <li><b>background-repeat:</b> determines how a specified background image 
      is repeated (default is no-repeat) </li>
    <li><b>background-color:</b> sets the background color behind the image. color 
        value format is #xxxxxx, where xxxxxx is a hex string specifying the color 
        in RGB. 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Example custom.css file</b><br>
    This example shows configuration of the library banner. 
    <pre> #brand { 
        height: 50px; 
        background-image: url("MyBrand.gif"); 
        background-repeat: no-repeat; 
        background-color: #339933; 
     } </pre>

<h3><a name="footer">Customize the Footer for all Web Pages</a></h3>
<ul>
  <p>The footer of each web page can be customized as needed for your 
    installation. You may want to add additional information for terms of use, 
    privacy, help desk contact information, etc. 
  <p>To customize the footer pages, create the following html files in <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/customer/logidex.war/custom.  The application will have to be redeployed after changes have been made.
  <ul>
    <li>i_footer.html 
  </ul>
  <p>This file can be customized using standard html syntax. 
  <p><b>Note</b>: The styles in this document may override the global 
    defaults. For example, the style sheet entry "<tt>A:hover { COLOR: #FFFFFF; 
    TEXT-DECORATION: underline; }</tt>" will override the hover link color for 
    the whole page.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a name="homepage" id="homepage">Customize Home Page Content (Web Browser Application)</a></h3>
<ul>
  <p>You can customize the content presented on the home page of the web browser application. The area available for custom content falls below the web page <a href="#topbanner">Top Banner</a> and above the Active Project designation on the home page. This configuration is global to this installation, 
     which means it will be in effect for all libraries on your installation. 
  <ol>
    <li>Create a jsp file named i_home.jsp with your custom content.</li>
    <li>Save this file to: $LOGIDEX_ROOT/customer/logidex.war/custom directory</li>

<h3><a name="supportpage" id="supportpage">Customize Support Center Page</a></h3>
<ul>
  <p>You may customize the content presented on the Support Center page of the web browser application. The area
   available for custom content is the Support Information section. This configuration is global to this installation, 
   which means it will be in effect for all libraries on your installation. Library Administrators and Usage Controllers
   continue to see the default information.
  <ol>
    <li>Create an html file named i_support_info.html with your custom content.</li>
    <li>Save this file to: {APPLICATION_ROOT}/customer/logidex.war/custom directory. Create the directory, if necessary.</li>

<h3><a name="topnavlinks" id="topnavlinks">Customize  Top Navigation Links (Web Browser Application)</a></h3>
<ul>
  <p>You may change the target for the top navigation bar "Discussion" and "Help" links.
    This configuration is library-specific and can be different for each library.
  <ol><li>Access the Support Center page
    <li>Click Configure Library
    <li>Enter your desired URL's into the Help URL and/or Discussion URL fields

<h3><a name="language">Using different languages</a></h3>
<p>Portfolio Manager and Lifecycle Manager can be configured so the user can select what language 
  to display its contents. Contact <a href="mailto:llsupport@soa.com">support</a> 
  for information on which languages are available and how to configure them. 
<hr>
<h3><a name="altuser">Running with an alternate database user</a></h3>
<p>By default, the database schema owner is used to create and modify the
  database entities (tables, views, sequences, etc). If you would like to configure 
  a different user, there will be some actions that do not work 
  as they modify the underlying schema. These actions need to be performed as 
  the schema owner and therefore if you have configured an alternate 
  database user, you will see certain permission issues running them. Portfolio Manager or Lifecycle Manager 
  must be reconfigured to use the schema owner in this case. The potentially problematic 
  actions are: 
<ul>
  <li>Creating a library 
  <li>Removing a library 
  <li>Using the SetAttributeDefinitions command 
  <li>Other commands that may modify the database schema 
</ul>
<p>If you would like to configure an alternate database user, follow 
  these instructions. 
<ol>
  <li>Run the <a href="#gengrants">GenGrants</a> command and save the result to 
    a file 
  <li>Copy the file to the database server 
  <li>Execute the SQL against the database 
  <li>Modify the <a href="#config">configuration file</a> and set 
    the database.schema.name to the schema the tables are in. Remember 
    to run <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/bin/install update-config 
  <li>Modify the JDBC resource in the application server to use the alternate 
    database user and password 
  <li>Restart the application server 
</ol>
<p>Other setup notes: 
<ul>
  <li>If you are using any of the standard reports, which are available on a new 
    library or if you run the CreateStandardReports command, then you'll have 
    to set the database_schema_name parameter on the reporting links to the database 
    schema owner. For example you may need to modify or append "&amp;database_schema_name=logidex" 
    to all the standard reports. 
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="customjar">Deploying custom class files</a></h3>
<p>In certain instances, such as creating custom listeners, deploying custom class files is required.
This is accomplished by adding your class files to the <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/customer/custom.jar file.  You'll need to ensure the package information is 
preserved in the class file's path.  For instance, suppose you have a class named <code>com.example.CustomListener</code>.  
It will need to be added to the custom.jar file as <code>com/example/CustomListener.class</code>.  Here is an example of the required steps:
<ol>
<li>Create a directory called <code>/tmp/com/example</code>
<li>Copy the class file to the <code>/tmp/com/example</code> directory
<li>cd to the <code>/tmp</code> directory
<li>Run <code>jar uvf <i>ApplicationRoot</i>/customer/custom.jar com/example/CustomListener.class</code>
</ol>

Deploy the application by performing an upgrade to make the jar available. Some custom classes are cached by the application in
the database so, when replacing a custom listener class with an updated version, it's best to reload the LPC in any libraries where
your custom listeners will run. See the commands GetCurrentProcessConfiguration and SetProcessConfiguration in the <a href="#admincmd">Commands</a> 
section of this document.

<h3><a name="largeartifacts">Notes on Uploading Large Artifacts</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>WebLogic 
    <p>WebLogic uses /tmp/_wl_proxy to write the file while it is being uploaded. 
      Typical problems tend to be a permissions/mode or disk full problem. Verify 
      you have enough space in /tmp for a file at least the size you are trying 
      to upload. 
    <p>Also verify that the /tmp/_wl_proxy directory is owned by the web server 
      user (User and Group in the httpd.conf file). You can delete the /tmp/_wl_proxy 
      directory and it will be recreated with the correct permissions. 
    <p> 
  <li>WebSphere 
    <p>There is a configuration element in the plugin-cfg.xml web server plug-in 
      configuration file which limits uploads to 10MB by default. To increase 
      the limit to (for example) 30MB, change the following line in the WebSphere 
      plugin-cfg.xml file. <pre>from &lt;ServerGroup Name="MY_NODE/Default Server"&gt;
to &lt;ServerGroup Name="MY_NODE/Default Server" PostSizeLimit="30000000"&gt;</pre>

<h3><a name="utf8">Saving files in UTF-8</a></h3>
<p>One needs to be concerned 
  with saving files that have non-ASCII characters. There are several different 
  encodings that one can use to safely preserve extended characters (UTF-16, UTF-8, 
  etc). Portfolio Manager and Lifecycle Manager use UTF-8 encoding in various places throughout the application. 
  Most of these issues should be transparent to the end-user, but some should 
  be noted. Whereever input takes the form of an XML file, the XML 
  file has a declaration for specifying the encoding. Even if it is not specified, 
  the default encoding is UTF-8 and the document will be interpreted as being 
  encoded as such. It is recommended to leave this set to UTF-8 and ensure that 
  your file is saved in UTF-8. 
<p>Most XML files displayed to the user will be preserved as UTF-8 if they are 
  saved using the browser’s File -&gt; Save As option. Do not copy and paste this 
  text from the browser to a text editor unless you know the text will be preserved 
  as UTF-8 encoded without a BOM (byte-order mark). 
<p>Also, if overviews are uploaded using Automation Extensions, they should be encoded using UTF-8 .
<p>It is very easy to mess up a file by saving it in the incorrect encoding. Therefore 
  these instructions should be used anytime you save a file containing non-ASCII 
  characters. 
<ul>
  <li><b>Notepad:</b> Choose the File menu, then Save As. Under the Encoding dropdown, 
    select UTF-8 and save the file. 
  <li><b>WordPad:</b> WordPad does not handle UTF-8 encodings, use Notepad instead. 
    WordPad does have a Unicode option, but unfortunately this is UTF-16, not 
    UTF-8. 
  <li><b>Vim:</b> Some UNIX systems have an enhanced version of VI installed called 
    Vim. Use the command ":set encoding=utf-8" when saving your file. 
  <li><b>Visual Studio:</b> Choose the File menu, then Advanced Save Option. In 
    the Encoding dropdown, select Unicode (UTF-8 <b>without</b> signature) - Codepage 
    65001.

<h3><a name="userlicensereport">User License Report</a></h3>
<p>A User License Report is included which you may link to in an appropriate group 
   of your choice. The report provides a list of all users on the installation and
   the libraries to which each user has access. Create the report link as follows:
   <ol>
     <li>Log into a library as a Usage Controller
     <li>Click the View All link next to Reports
     <li>Click Manage Reports
     <li>Click Add Report for an appropriate group or project where you would like all users to see this report link
     <li>Enter a meaningful name and description
     <li>Enter the URL: {your server host}/lm/birt/run?__report=/reports/AdminUserLicense.rptdesign&amp;database_schema_name=
     <li>Note: the value for the database_schema_name parameter is optional unless you connect to the database as a user other than the schema owner.
   </ol>

 <h3><a name="managereports">Managing Reports</a></h3>
<p>Customers may use the BIRT Eclipse tool to create custom reports and deploy those reports to the application server to be available to application
users. Beginning in RM and PortM 6.3.1, BIRT reports are managed using the Configuration Designer plug-in. The report design files appear in your 
configuration project under Document-Source -> reports. Custom reports may be saved to this folder and uploaded to the library via the context menu.
Once a report has been uploaded to the library, follow the steps below to create the report link.
<br> <br>
 For version 6.5 installations, follow these steps once a report is ready to deploy:
 <ol>
    <li>Be sure to replace the datasource property in your report design with the datasource used in SOA Software's standard reports. Compare the XML 
        report designs for details.
 </ol>
<p>
   Create the report link as follows:
   <ol>
     <li>Log into a library as a Usage Controller
     <li>Click the View All link next to Reports
     <li>Click Manage Reports
     <li>Click Add Report for an appropriate group or project where you would like all users to see this report link
     <li>Enter a meaningful name and description
     <li>Enter the URL: {your server host}/{context root}/birt/run?__report=/reports/{your report name}&amp;database_schema_name=
     <li>Note: the value for the database_schema_name parameter is optional unless you connect to the database as a user other than the schema owner.
