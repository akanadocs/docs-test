<h2><a name="adminaccounts">Administrator Accounts</a></h2>
<ul>
  <p>There are three different and distinct administrator roles that can 
    be assigned to user accounts within the application. All three roles are described here in 
    order to provide context for the Installation Administrator responsibilities 
    and required skills as described in this document.

    <dd>This <i>System Admin Guide</i> is written and intended for the 
        users assigned the role of Installation Administrator, also known as the <i>system administrator</i> for this 
        installation. See <a href="#adminlogin">System Admin Console</a> for information on the UI provided
        to Installation Administrators. The initial list of Installation Admins is set in the lib.conf file
        in the {admin.users} property. After the initial installation, the list is maintained
        by the existing Installation Administrators through use of the Admin Console's Settings page. 
	See the section <a href="#installationproperties">Update Installation-wide Properties</a>
        for more details. <p>Responsibilities of the Installation Administrator generally include these types of activities: 
      <ul>

<h2><a name="adminlogin">Admin Console for the Installation Administrator</a></h2>
<h3>System Admin Console Access</h3>
<p>Lifecycle Manager provide access to a number of administrative functions via the System 
  Admin Console. This application can be accessed from within a web 
  browser (from the top navigation bar item called <b>Administration</b> 
  that is available to users who are installation administrators) and also directly 
  by URL as follows. Replace the "/lm" in the examples with your context root, 
  as appropriate. The context root is "logiclibrary" for systems that are upgraded
  from Logidex.</p>
<ul>
  <li><pre>http://{web.server.url.host}/lm/admin/mainMenu.do</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>Login: anyone in {admin.users}</pre></li>
      <li><pre>Password: a password specific to the user in {admin.users} </pre> 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Super user access is only available from the following URL and is meant 
    to be used only when the standard LDAP accounts are not available 
    <ul>

<h3>System Admin Console Main Menu</h3>
<p>From the system admin console, the Installation Administrator can perform a 
  number of administrative tasks. Here are the items provided in the Main Menu:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p><b>Execute Command</b> - Selecting this item displays a page where you 
      can enter a command and the applicable command parameters.</p>

  <li> 
    <p><b>Create New Library</b> - Click on this link to display the Create 
      Library page. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Create Lifecycle Manager User</b> - [Only valid when using LDAP in Native mode] Selecting this item displays a page where
		you can create a new LDAP user and assign it to a specific library.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><b><a href="#ManageVAS">Manage Visible Asset Sources </a></b>- Selecting 
      this item and designating your library from the drop down list produces 
      a listing of the Visible Asset Sources that are available to your library. 
      A Visible Asset Source is a configuration that causes assets published from 
      an individual library's asset source to be simultaneously published into 
      your library as well. You can use Visible Asset Sources to create a &quot;federated&quot; 
      library configuration with other libraries both in your Lifecycle Manager installation 
      and from a remote Lifecycle Manager installation.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><b><a name="RemoteAssetSource"></a>Manage Remote Asset Sources </b>- Selecting 
      this item produces a listing of the Remote Asset Sources currently available 
      to your installation. A Remote Asset Source is a connection established 
      to a library that exists on an installation separate from your own. 
      Creating a Remote Asset Source results in the availability of the remote 
      library for the creation of a visible asset source for a library local to 
      your installation. See &quot;Manage Visible Asset Sources&quot; in the previous 
      bullet. A Remote Asset Source entry establishes connection information to 
      the remote library, as well as a polling interval for the update of published 
      asset information between systems. </p>

<h4><a name="ManageVAS"></a>Visible Asset Sources</h4>
<p>Each library consists of two components: the <i>library</i> itself, 
  which contains the published assets, and its associated <i>asset source, </i>where 
  assets are created and edited prior to being published. When assets are published 
  from an asset source into its associated library, you can also designate that 
  a simultaneous publish take place into other libraries as well. The configuration 
  necessary to cause this to take place occurs in the target library and consists 
  of the establishment of a Visible Asset Source for each source library desired. 
  Libraries that share content in this fashion are said to be &quot;federated&quot;. 
  Note that content shared in this manner can include reference models as well 
  as assets. Published assets are refreshed in all applicable libraries with each 
  publish from the originating asset source. In cases where the Visible Asset 
  Source entry uses a remote library, the update takes place according to the 
  polling interval established by the Remote Asset Source entry used by the Visible 
  Asset Source. </p>
<h4>Create a Visible Asset Source</h4>
<p>On the Manage Visible Asset Sources page, selecting your library from the Library 
  drop down list causes the page to refresh and display a list of all other libraries 
  existing for your installation. If you want to pull assets and models from a 
  visible library into your library, click on the corresponding <b>Selected</b> 
  box. As you do so, there are two important things to consider and choices to 
  make:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that you select a <b>Responsible User</b> that corresponds to a user 
    account in your library that is associated with the &quot;Reporting Group&quot; 
    you intend. The responsible user's reporting group will: 
    <ol>
      <li>Be used as the owning group for the assets from this asset source.</li>
      <li>Designate the publish template(s) to be used for the assets published 
        from this asset source. The publish template used for these assets can: 
        <ol>
          <li>Provide publish information, such as designation of private artifacts 
            and establishment of asset owner involvement in asset reuse approvals.</li>
          <li>Automatically establish forum topics for the assets' discussion 
            forums.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Note: the default &quot;Responsible User&quot; account is the account 
        called <i>Repository Application</i>. This is a user account associated with 
        the application itself, not a human user. The 
        <i><a href="#SuperUser">Super user</a></i><a href="#SuperUser"> 
        account</a> is configured in your web browser application in a 
        fashion similar to other user accounts.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Establish a Classification Criteria Set to use as a stereotype in order 
    to filter the assets published from the Visible Asset Source. By naming a 
    classification criteria set, you cause only those assets that meet the classification 
    criteria of the named set to be included in the publish. Classification Criteria 
    Sets (CCSs) are created and managed by your library's Usage Controller(s) 
    through your web browser application.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the help system available online in the application 
  for more information on: Classification Criteria Sets, Publish Templates and 
  their association with groups and asset types, asset publish information, Reporting 
  Groups, and Reference Models.<br>

<h2><a name="settings">Installation Settings</a></h2>
<ul>
<h3>General Settings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Use SSL</b> - If checked SSL will be used for generated URLs and login redirects.
    <li><b>Host</b> - The host to use for generated URLs to the application.
    <li><b>Port</b> - The port to use for generated URLs to the application.
    <li><b>Context Root</b> - The context root the application is hosted on.  Changing this does not change where the application is deployed, but is used for generated URLs to the application.
    <li><b>Administration Users</b> - A semi-colon separated list of user accounts that have access to the admin pages.
    <li><b>Show Library List</b> - If checked, shows a dropdown of available libraries on the login page
    <li><b>Default Sort Classifiers</b> - A colon separated list of classifier names that is used for new library default sort classifiers and asset tree hierarchy.
  </ul>
<h3>Cache Settings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Asset Cache Size</b> - The number of assets to cache in memory.
    <li><b>Org Group Cache Size</b> - The number of org groups to cache in memory.
    <li><b>User Cache Size</b> - The number of users to cache in memory.
  </ul>
<h3>E-mail Settings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Host</b> - The SMTP server's host.
    <li><b>Port</b> - The SMTP server's port.  If not specified, port 25 will be used.
    <li><b>Enabled</b> - If checked the libraries will send email.  This can be used to temporarily disable email.
  </ul>
<h3>LDAP Settings</h3>
<p>LDAP is used for authentication, searching for users, and authorization (if group / role based support is enabled).  Various LDAP settings are available from the administration console (Settings -> LDAP Settings).  This section describes the various settings and their purpose.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Host</b> - The hostname of the LDAP server
    <li><b>Port</b> - The port of the LDAP server. If this is not specified it will default to 389 for LDAP, or 636 for LDAPS
    <li><b>Use LDAPS</b> - If this is checked, LDAPS:// will be used to connect to the LDAP server, otherwise the LDAP:// protocol will be used.
    <li><b>Bind DN</b> - The LDAP DN of the user to authenticate with to perform searches.  If this is not specified no user will be used to authenticate.
    <li><b>Bind Password</b> - The LDAP bind DN's password.
    <li><b>Follow Referrals</b> - Referrals are a mechanism to indicate that the entries you are looking for may be located on another server.  
	If this is checked, the application will consult the other server for these entries.  This incurs a performance penalty.
    <li><b>Native Mode</b> - This should not normally be checked in a corporate environment.  This allows the application to make updates to the LDAP server (e.g. create users, set passwords).
<h4>User LDAP Settings</h4>
  <li><b>Base DN</b> - The LDAP DN defining where to start searching for LDAP users.
  <li><b>Search Scope</b> - Whether to search all levels below the base DN (Sub) or just the first level (One) for users.
  <li><b>Object Class</b> - The LDAP object class representing groups (e.g. 'inetOrgPerson', or 'organizationalPerson').
  <li><b>Account Attribute</b> - The LDAP attribute representing the user's account name (e.g. 'samAccountName' or 'uid').
  <li><b>MemberOf attribute</b> - The LDAP attribute representing which groups this user is a member of (e.g. 'memberOf').
  <li><b>Filter</b> - An additional LDAP filter used to restrict which LDAP entries are considered users.
<h4>Group LDAP Settings</h4>
<p>Group Settings are optional unless <a href="#ldapgrouproles">Group / Role</a> mappings are used
  <li><b>Base DN</b> - The LDAP DN defining where to start searching for LDAP groups.
  <li><b>Search Scope</b> - Whether to search all levels below the base DN (Sub) or just the first level (One) for groups.
  <li><b>Object Class</b> - The LDAP object class representing groups (e.g. 'groupOfUniqueNames' or 'groupOfNames').
  <li><b>Name Attribute</b> - The LDAP attribute representing the group name (e.g. 'CN').
  <li><b>Member attribute</b> - The LDAP attribute representing membership in this group (e.g. 'uniqueMember' or 'member').
  <li><b>Filter</b> - An additional LDAP filter used to restrict which LDAP entries are considered groups.
  </ul>
<h3>Logging Settings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Properties</b> - The logging properties.  Normally, this does not need to be changed, except perhaps the logging paths.
    <li><b>Logging Level</b> - The level at which logging statements (at or more severe) will be logged.
    <li><b>Persist Across Restart</b> - If set, the logging changes will be persisted in the database and will be applied when a server is restarted.
  </ul>
<h3>Database Settings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Schema Name</b> - The schema name containing the application data (tables, views, etc.).  
If not specified the default schema of the connecting database user is used.
    <li><b>Data Tablespace Name</b> - The database tablespace containing the table data.
    <li><b>Index Tablespace Name</b> - The database tablespace containing the index data.
    <li><b>Long Tablespace Name</b> - The database tablespace containing LOB (Large Object) data.
    <li><b>Temp Tablespace Name</b> - The database tablespace used for temporary data.
    <li><b>Schema Updateable</b> - If checked, indicates the schema is modifiable by the database user. This is used to update some dynamic reporting views.
  </ul>
<h3>SSO Settings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>User ID Header</b> -  The header containing an externally authenticated (via SSO) account ID.  This header name should be set and validated via
an external application (normally a web-server plugin).
    <li><b>Challenge URL</b> - The URL to direct the user to when they need to provide authentication.  By default, this is the application's authentication page.
    <li><b>Logout Redirect URL</b> - The URL to direct the user to when they log out. By default, this is the application's authentication page.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2><a name="configdesigner">Configuration Designer</a></h2>
<ul>
   <p>The Eclipse-based Configuration Designer (CD) plug-in provides library administrators a rich client interface to 
      manage the configuration for their libraries. CD is included in the Repository Client--a standalone, Eclipse-based IDE--or
      the plug-in may be installed into an existing Eclipse IDE. See the Download Center in your library for installation details. Once installed,
      administrators create one or more CD projects where each contains the configuration for a library. The following table outlines common 
      administrative functions and the project file(s) associated with that function.
   <table border="1">
   
    <tr>

<h2><a name="ldappassword">Setting up native LDAP password policies</a></h2>
<p>There is basic support for password policies when using native LDAP (where the application manages users instead of an externally managed LDAP system).
These password rules are enforced whenever a user requests an account or changes their password.

<p>The following properties are available to set using the <a href="#admincmdinstallation">SetInstallationProperty</a> command:
  <ul>
    <li>password.rule.min_length - the password's minimum length 
    <li>password.rule.max_length - the password's maximum length
    <li>password.rule.min_upper_case_count - the minimum number of upper case characters the password must contain
    <li>password.rule.min_lower_case_count - the minimum number of lower case characters the password must contain
    <li>password.rule.min_digit_count - the minimum number of digits the password must contain
    <li>password.rule.min_symbol_count - the minimum number of non-alphanumeric characters the password must contain
    <li>password.rule.max_repeat_count - the maximum number of consecutive characters that can appear in the password
  </ul>

<h3>Advanced policy controls</h3>
OpenLDAP has additional password policy support in addition to the password complexity support specified above.  This includes account lockout, grace authentication, and password expiration rules.  To enable these requires modifying OpenLDAP accordingly.
The steps below are from Lifecycle Manager version 7.1 and below where we show an example of running OpenLDAP using a static slapd.conf configuration file.  However if you are running OpenLDAP using the newer on-line configuration (OLC),
we defer to your LDAP administrators.  In essence, you need to include OpenLDAP's Password Policy schema (ppolicy) and overlay, then create a default policy DN and populate it with the desired Password Policy attributes outlined below.
  <ol>
  <li>Stop the ldap server (e.g. bin/slapd stop)
  <li>Do the following to the conf/slapd.conf file.
	<ul>
	<li>Add this line at the top after the other schema includes, adjust the paths accordingly:
		<pre>include         /etc/openldap/schema/ppolicy.schema</pre>
	<li>Add this line near the middle next to the other moduleload entries.  This loads the password overlay policy
		<pre>moduleload      ppolicy.la</pre>
	<li>Add these lines at the bottom.  This enables the policy settings to be sourced from the "cn=defaultpolicy,ou=people,dc=Logidex" LDAP entry.  
		<pre>overlay ppolicy

    on the type of LDAP and application server you have installed. 
  <p> 
  <ol>
    <li>Configure and setup the LDAP server with a certificate to use for SSL 
    <li>Export the certificate and save it in DER format (other formats may work). 
    <li>Import the certificate into the keystore for the Akana Platform (using the JRE's keytool command to import into {platform_home}/jre/lib/security/cacerts):
	  <ul>
	    <li>{platform_home}/jre/bin/keytool -import -v -alias {CERT_ALIAS} -file /home/akana/{cert_name}.crt -keystore {platform_home}/jre/lib/security/cacerts

<h2><a name="ldapgrouproles">Setting up Group and Role support in LDAP</a></h2>
<ul>
  <p>LDAP groups can be used to define organization group membership and user roles
for the application.  A limitation of LDAP based mappings is that group and role combinations that are easily
specified in the library, cannot be easily represented in LDAP.  Therefore roles are either associated with groups or projects.
The group/role combinations a user is granted are formed from the set of LDAP group-based mapped roles a user has with the LDAP group mapped groups 
a user belongs to.  Likewise this is done for the LDAP project-based mapped roles a user has with the LDAP group mapped projects.
These roles are applied to the user on login or project / group create.

<p>For example
<ul>
<li>If a user belongs to an LDAP 
group mapped to the "Enterprise Group" and belongs to an LDAP group mapped to an "Architect" role (defined to be a group-based role), the user
will be granted the Architect Role on the Enterprise group.  
<li>If the user also belongs to an LDAP group mapped to the "Development Project" project, and belongs
to an LDAP group mapped to the "Project Manager" role (defined as a project-based role), they will be a project manager for the Development Project.
<li>The user will not be granted the "Architect" role for the "Development Project" or a "Project Manager" role for the "Enterprise Group" because 
"Architect" is a group-based role and "Development Project" is a project, correspondingly "Project Manager" is a project-based role and "Enterprise Group" is a group.
</ul>

<h3>Special role considerations</h3>
<p>There are several built-in roles, which can be mapped to LDAP groups.
<ul>
<li>"Project Manager".  This is a project-based role.  It cannot be defined as a group-based role.
<li>"ACE" - Asset Capture Engineer.  This is the role that can edit assets and is a project-based role.  If a user is assigned to a project via an LDAP group, they will also get the ACE role by default.
<li>"Asset Publisher".  This is a seldom seen role and by default is a project-based role.  If a user has any project based roles, they will also get the Asset Publisher role by default.
<li>"Library Administrator".  This allows a user to make configuration changes to the library.  It is a library-wide role and the user does not need to belong to any LDAP mapped organizational group to get this role.
</ul>

<h3>Mapping</h3>
<p>For group / role mapping to work, the application must be able to determine a user's LDAP group membership.  This can be accomplished in one of two ways.  
The group membership may be on the LDAP entry, or the group may contain the LDAP user DNs that belong to it. 
To be able to determine group membership, the LDAP Settings from the Administration console need to be setup.  
In the case where the LDAP user entry contains the list of groups it belongs to, the memberOf user attribute can be specified.  If the LDAP groups contain the list of users that belong to it, the group section should be filled out (base DN, search scope, name attribute, member attribute).

<p>By default, LDAP group membership will be done on a name matching basis to application organizational groups and role names.  
Therefore, if the library has roles defined as "Architect" and "Project Manager" (built-in), and Organizational Groups "Enterprise" and "Development Group",
users will be granted rights based on LDAP groups with the same names: "Architect", "Project Manager", "Enterprise", and "Development Group".
These names can be mapped differently using the mapping document.  Any names that are not mapped will fall back to the default behavior.

<p>The mapping document can be set or retrieved using the GetGroupRoleDefinitions and SetGroupRoleDefinitions commands.  An example format is as follows:
<p>This document defines 3 role mappings and two group mappings (one group, one project).  The "ACE" role is mapped to an LDAP group called "Asset Editor", 
the "Enterprise Group" is mapped to an LDAP group called "Enterprise".  The "ACE" and "Project Manager" roles are defined as project-based, the Architect role is group based.

<h2><a name="usessl">Setting up SSL</a></h2>
<ul>
<p>Lifecycle Manager support the use of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption.  However, 
by default, the installation is not configured to use SSL.  If you want to use SSL for your installation,
you will need to modify the Akana Platform container configuration running the Lifecycle Manager features.<br><br>

You will need to obtain (or generate a self-signed) certificate and corresponding private key from your organizations Certificate Authority (CA).  
The certificate will need to be in Base64 encoded DER format, and the key will need to be in PKCS8 format.<br><br>
An example of a quick self-signed certificate/key generation (note, that these steps require the OpenSSL packages and that these specific commands are using a deprecated SHA1 signature that is being called attention to by most browsers on 1/1/17):<br><br>

<li>1st; Generate LM's SSL cert and key; a traditional way to generate the cert/key with full cert properties:<br><br>
<ul>
# Generate the key:
<pre>
[akana@lxc1-pm8x-19 certs]$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out lxc1-pm8x-19.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 1024 bit long modulus
</pre>
# Generate the csr:
<pre>
[akana@lxc1-pm8x-19 certs]$ openssl req -new -key lxc1-pm8x-19.key -out lxc1-pm8x-19.csr
</pre>
# Remove passphrase from key:
<pre>
[akana@lxc1-pm8x-19 certs]$ cp lxc1-pm8x-19.key lxc1-pm8x-19.key.orig
[akana@lxc1-pm8x-19 certs]$ openssl rsa -in lxc1-pm8x-19.key.orig -out lxc1-pm8x-19.key
</pre>
# Generate the cert:
<pre>
[akana@lxc1-pm8x-19 certs]$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in lxc1-pm8x-19.csr -signkey lxc1-pm8x-19.key -out lxc1-pm8x-19.local.akana.com.crt
Signature ok
</pre>
</ul>
<li>...as an alternative, you could use the following one-liner (note that in the following example, we're naming the key as key.pem and cert and cert.pem whereas the examples above were based on he hostname...):
<ul>
<pre>
[akana@lxc1-pm8x-19 certs]$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=lxc1-pm8x-19.local.akana.com'
</pre>
</ul>
<li>2nd; Convert the private key to pk8 (this is required for either method of generating the cert)!:
<ul>
<pre>
[akana@lxc1-pm8x-19 certs]$ openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -in key.pem -outform PEM -out key.pk8 -nocrypt
</pre>
</ul>
<li>3rd; create an <b>{platform_home}/instances/{instance_name}/deploy/com.soa.transport.jetty.endpoint-{instance_name}.cfg</b> transport config file using the cert and key. <b>Note that you'll copy/paste the contents 
of the cert and key files without line breaks in-between the the following tags</b>: <br>
<ul>
<pre>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</pre>
...and...
<pre>
 -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
 -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
</pre>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Example com.soa.transport.jetty.endpoint-lm.cfg (https.private.key is the private key, and https.private.key.cert.chain is the certificate!):
<pre>
http.url=https://lxc1-pm8x-19.local.akana.com:9443
https.private.key=MIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgwggSkAgEAAoIBAQC66WWIU5frKWw8aKA...

scheme=https
https.need.client.auth=false
https.want.client.auth=false
</pre>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>4th; The Plat jvm needs to trust the ssl cert:
<ul>
<li># Delete any existing cert for the host using the same alias:
<pre>
[akana@lxc1-pm8x-19 log]$ /opt/akana/plat8/jre/bin/keytool -delete -alias LXC1PM8X19 -keystore /opt/akana/plat8/jre/lib/security/cacerts
Enter keystore password:
</pre>
<li># Then add cert:
<pre>
[akana@lxc1-pm8x-19 log]$ /opt/akana/plat8/jre/bin/keytool -import -v -alias LXC1PM8X19 -file /home/akana/certs/092616_1510/cert.pem -keystore /opt/akana/plat8/jre/lib/security/cacerts
Enter keystore password:
...
Trust this certificate? [no]: yes
Certificate was added to keystore
[Storing /opt/akana/plat8/jre/lib/security/cacerts]
</pre>
</ul>

<li>5th; Configure LM's /admin console's Settings -> General Settings -> [x] SSL checkbox and Port: properties so that LM's redirect logic and URL builder use the HTTPS protocol and the correct port.
<!--
<li>5th; Configure the container's admin port to listen on a secure port.  Modify the {platform_home}/instances/{container_name}/system.properties, and change the 
following property:
<ul>
<pre>
org.osgi.service.http.port=9900
</pre>
to
<pre>
org.osgi.service.http.port.secure=9443
</pre>
... the port chosen should align with the port of the http.url that you chose in the step 3...

<h2><a name="logs">Log Files and Logging Levels</a></h2>
<h4>Log files and location</h4>
  <p>Below is a brief description of the most important log files (not all of 
    the log files are listed here). 
  <p>By default the log files are in the directory <b>{platform_home}/instances/{instance_name}/log</b>
  <h4>Changing the logging levels</h4>
  The logging level may be changed dynamically at runtime through the Administration console (Settings -> Logging Settings). 
  <p>Sample Logging file: 
  <table border="0">
    <tr> 
      <td> 
        <pre>
.level=INFO
com.logiclibrary.level=INFO

handlers=com.logiclibrary.common.logging.ThreadFileHandler, com.logiclibrary.common.logging.IncidentHandler

com.logiclibrary.common.logging.IncidentHandler.count=10
com.logiclibrary.common.logging.IncidentHandler.limit=1000000
com.logiclibrary.common.logging.IncidentHandler.pattern=/opt/lm/logs/webapp/incident_%g.log

com.logiclibrary.common.logging.ThreadFileHandler.count=10
com.logiclibrary.common.logging.ThreadFileHandler.limit=5000000
com.logiclibrary.common.logging.ThreadFileHandler.pattern=/opt/lm/logs/webapp/lm_%g.log

com.logiclibrary.common.logging.FileHandler.pattern=/opt/lm/logs/webapp/lm_%g.log
</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  The only parameters that should need to be changed are the pathnames where the 
  log files are placed and the logging level. The *.pattern properties specify 
  where to place individual log files and how to number them; the %g is replaced 
  with a sequential number. Logs are always written to the '0' log file.  One it fills up
  logs are archived so that '0' becomes '1', '1' becomes '2', up to 'count-2' becomes 'count - 1'
  <p>Possible logging levels are as follows (from most verbose to no logging). 
  The most common ones are available from the log settings page, which will automatically update the log properties.
  <ul>
    <li>ALL 
    <li>FINEST 
    <li>FINER                         
    <li>FINE 
    <li>CONFIG 
    <li>INFO 
    <li>WARNING 
    <li>SEVERE 
    <li>OFF 
  </ul>
  <p>The default level for new installations is <b>FINER</b>, and can be changed to <b>ALL or 
    FINEST</b> to get more detailed debugging information. 
  <p>NOTE: Setting the logging level to one of the more "verbose" levels will 
    tend to slow down the performance of the application so you should only turn 
    up the logging if needed for debugging.

          including data, code, and configuration information. 
        <p>Prior to installing service packs you should do an installation backup. 
          Most service packs will be simple code updates, however there may be

<blockquote>
  <p>Lifecycle Manager provide the capability of accessing your libraries and your System 
    Admin console by logging in with a special &quot;user&quot; account that does 
    not require authentication by your LDAP system. This account, termed the &quot;Super 
    User&quot; account can be used via the web browser application to 
    access your library and the System Admin console. Logging in as Super User 
    provides you with unlimited access to the libraries of your installation and 
    the facilities provided by the System Admin console. Note that super user 
    access can be enabled or disabled in the <a href="#config">lib.conf</a> 
    file by assigning a password or leaving the password blank.</p>
  <h4>The Purpose of Super User</h4>
  <p>Super User access is provided to enable you to recover from the lack of an 
    active Library Administrator account. By logging into a library 
    as super user, you can activate an inactive account 
    or create a new user account and assign the Library Administrator role.</p>
  <p>Another purpose for the Super User account is to provide you with a user 
    account that is portrayed as being associated with the application 
    as opposed to being associated with an individual, human user. Lifecycle Manager provide
    for the use of the super user account as an &quot;application user&quot; called 
    <i>Repository Application</i>. This user is available for 
    such things as being recorded as the &quot;submitter&quot; of assets submitted 
    by automation and being identified as the &quot;responsible user&quot; 
    when establishing library federation through creation of <a href="#ManageVAS">Visible 
    Asset Source</a> and <a href="#RemoteAssetSource">Remote Asset Source</a> 
    configuration.</p>
  <h4> Super User Role Assignments</h4>
  <p>The Super User account is assigned the library roles 
    of Library Administrator, Usage Controller and Asset User. In addition, this 
    account is also assigned the group roles of Asset Capture Engineer (ACE), 
    Publisher and Asset Owner - all at the Enterprise Group level. See the

<h2><a name="attributedefinitions">Customize user attributes and LDAP 
  attributes</a></h2>
<ul>
  <p>The user properties that appear in the create and display user and contact 
    pages are obtained and configured through the attribute definitions. 
    Attribute definitions determine not only the names of fields that are available 
    and displayed for users, but also the corresponding services to 
    use when looking up user information. This is accomplished by configuring 
    an XML document and uploading it through the Admin Console using the 
    <a href="#admincmd">Attribute Definition</a> commands: GetAttributeDefinitionSchema, 
    GetCurrentAttributeDefinitions, GetDefaultAttributeDefinitions, and SetAttributeDefinitions. 
  <p>The following is an example document. 
  <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;ContactAttributeDefinitions xmlns="http://www.logiclibrary.com/2004/ContactAttributesXML"&gt;
        &lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Full Name" include-in-filter="true" include-in-list="true"&gt;
		&lt;ExternalSourceMapping source-id="LDAP" name-in-source="cn" /&gt;
	&lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
	&lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Email" include-in-filter="true" include-in-list="true"&gt;
		&lt;ExternalSourceMapping source-id="LDAP" name-in-source="mail" /&gt;
	&lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
        &lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="First Name" include-in-filter="false" include-in-list="false"&gt;
		&lt;ExternalSourceMapping source-id="LDAP" name-in-source="givenName" /&gt;
	&lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
        &lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Last Name" include-in-filter="false" include-in-list="false"&gt;
		&lt;ExternalSourceMapping source-id="LDAP" name-in-source="sn" /&gt;
	&lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
	&lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Phone" include-in-filter="false" include-in-list="true"&gt;&lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
	&lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Fax" include-in-filter="false" include-in-list="false"&gt;&lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
	&lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Cell" include-in-filter="false" include-in-list="false"&gt;&lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;
&lt;/ContactAttributeDefinitions&gt;
</pre>
  <p>Each AttributeDefinition element defines a user attribute that may be displayed 
    (through the attribute-name XML attribute). The "Full Name" and 
    "Email" attributes are the only ones required.
  <p>If the include-in-filter XML attribute is set to true, the attribute is searchable 
    in user create and list pages, otherwise it is not. 
  <p>The include-in-list XML attribute is currently ignored, and all attributes 
    will show up in user detail pages. 
  <p>The ExternalSourceMapping element determines which user attributes come from 
    external sources through the source-id XML attribute. Currently only "LDAP" 
    is supported, which signifies that LDAP is queried, and which LDAP element 
    is used (name-in-source attribute), for user information related to that particular 
    user attribute. If there is no associated ExternalSourceMapping element configured, 
    then a Usage Controller can set that particular user attribute in the library. 
    A user can also set any such attributes for their own account. 
  <p>The sample Attribute Definition document configures 7 possible attributes 
    for a user (Full Name, Email, First Name, Last Name, Phone, Fax, and Cell). 
    The sample document also states where the user attribute values should come 
    from in LDAP. In this case, the "Full Name" for a user comes from the LDAP 
    "cn" attribute, the "Email" for a user comes from the LDAP "mail" attribute, 
    and so on. The "Full Name" and "Email" attributes are the only searchable 
    attributes. 
  <p>One attribute that may be helpful to include is the account name of a user. 
    This may be configured by adding the following entry to the XML file and editing 
    the name-in-source attribute to correspond with the attribute you are using 
    to authenticate users through LDAP (the user's account name attribute 
    in the Admin Console's Settings -> LDAP Settings page): 
  <pre>
        &lt;AttributeDefinition attribute-name="Account Name" include-in-filter="true" include-in-list="false"&gt;
		&lt;ExternalSourceMapping source-id="LDAP" name-in-source="uid" /&gt;
	&lt;/AttributeDefinition&gt;

<h2><a name="artifactsearch">Full-text artifact search</a></h2>
  <h3>Full-text artifact search on Oracle</h3>  
  By default, new Lifecycle Manager installations perform full-text searching of asset artifacts on Oracle.  However if you've upgraded
  from RM 6.4, and had not yet enabled Full-text artifact searching on Oracle, perform the following steps:<br><br>
  Run the following to enable all asset queries to search for search terms within asset artifacts. <b>See also the installation property "database_text_enabled"
  in this document.</b> Note that there will be changes made to the database so the JDBC database user must have full privileges during this procedure.
  <ol>
     <li>Install Oracle Text.  This may have already been installed into the Oracle instance when it was created.  
       However if it was not you'll need to install it and ensure the default Oracle Text entities are installed.
       <ul>
         <li>The ORACLE_HOME/ctx/admin/defaults/drdef<i>lang</i>.sql script ensures the default stoplist, lexer, and wordlist are setup for your language.
             You'll need to run this script if these are not setup in the Oracle instance.
       </ul>
     </li>
    <li>On the Lifecycle Manager Server, from the Installation Admin Console:
      <ul>
        <li>Execute Command
        <li>Command name: EnableTextSearchOnOracle
        <li>Choose the desired library from the dropdown list
        <li>Invoke
        <li>Several confirmation messages are output
        <li>Repeat for each library where full text searching is desired
      </ul>
        If an error is generated such as:<br>
        "PLS-00201: identifier 'CTX_DDL' must be declared<br>
        ORA-06550: line 1, column 7:<br>
        PL/SQL: Statement ignored" <br>
        Have your DBA execute this SQL query: <br>
        GRANT CTXAPP TO <i>yourDBuser</i><br>
        Then re-run the command above.

    <li>On the database, execute the GRANT statements output from the command above. These are listed here:
        <ul>--Change "dbuser" to the database user name in your environment.<br>
        GRANT EXECUTE ON CTX_CLS TO <i>dbuser</i>;<br>
        GRANT EXECUTE ON CTX_DDL TO <i>dbuser</i>;<br>
        GRANT EXECUTE ON CTX_DOC TO <i>dbuser</i>;<br>
        GRANT EXECUTE ON CTX_OUTPUT TO <i>dbuser</i>;<br>
        GRANT EXECUTE ON CTX_QUERY TO <i>dbuser</i>;<br>
        GRANT EXECUTE ON CTX_REPORT TO <i>dbuser</i>;<br>
        GRANT EXECUTE ON CTX_THES TO <i>dbuser</i>;<br>
        
        </ul>
   </ol>
   After successful command completion, set the installation property "database_text_enabled" to true so new libraries are automatically indexed.
  </p>
  <h3>Full-text artifact search on SQL Server</h3>  
  <p>Full-text searching is enabled by default on SQL Server.  
  However SQL Server only "knows" how to index certain types of artifacts depending on which filters are installed.
  <p>Details on filters can be found <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142499.aspx">here</a>.
  To determine which filters are installed on SQL Server, execute the following SQL: 
  <p><code>EXEC sp_help_fulltext_system_components 'filter';</code>
<hr>
<h2><a name="installationproperties">Update Installation-wide Properties</a></h2>
<ul>
  <p>This section is mostly deprecated because installation properties are updated through the Administration Console's Settings page.

  <p>Most of the configuration values that are set through the Administration Console's Settings page during the initial installation, 
	However the following can also be updated through the UI via the Execute Command's 
     <a href="#admincmdinstallation">SetInstallationProperty</a>. This command works by manipulating override values that are stored in a database table. If no
     value has been set via SetInstallationProperty, or if a blank value is set, then the system uses values from the deployment
     descriptor--built from the 'conf' file properties--as was the case in previous releases. Use "GetInstallationProperty" 
     to view a property value as set in the configuration file and the value persisted in the database, if it exists. Take care to 
     not misconfigure properties that could lock you out of the system (e.g. LDAP parameters). The following table describes the 
     properties that can and cannot be set by this method.

<h2><a name="sso">Single Sign-on (SSO) Installation and Configuration</a></h2>
<ul>
  <p>Single Sign-on (SSO) is a login mechanism that allows authorization by an 
    external web server plug-in. This enables you to integrate with your 
    own "single sign on" solution.  <br>External (thick) clients such as the Exclipse,.NET or 
	the Automation Extensions will still prompt for authentication, meaning that they
	will not authenticate through your SSO provider.
  <p>Note: You will <b>need</b> to use a front facing web server proxy running a single sign-on agent to enforce that all traffic to the 
  application has been authenticated/authorized.  See your specific SSO implementation documentation.
  <p>This capability is enabled by configuring the following property in the Admin Console Settings (Settings -> SSO Settings)
    <pre> userIdHeader= </pre> 
  <p>The value of this entry should specify the HTTP header name that 
    contains the authenticated user's user id (account name).
    So, for example if the User ID Header specifies "XYZ_USERID", 
    the logon logic will look for a HTTP Header
    with that name. Effectively, you enable external authorization by specifying 
    non-null values for this entry. 
  <p>If incoming HTTP request contains the specified header, the login 
    logic assumes that this user has been authenticated externally and does not 
    present a login challenge page. Instead, it attempts to find an existing User 
    object with the account name specified by the configured user id header.
    It then uses the 
    found User object to establish a session for the user. 
  <p>When properly configured and integrated with an external authentication mechanism, 
    users never see the login challenge. Instead they see the challenge 
    presented by the external authentication mechanism. In this mode it is not 
    necessary for Usage Controllers to define new users. 
    <p>When external authorization is configured, No "Logout" link appears on 
      the top navigation bar. 
  <p>The following resources should not be protected from SSO authorization:
    <ul>
      <li><i>contextroot</i>/application/access
      <li><i>contextroot</i>/ServerInfo
      <li><i>contextroot</i>/services
      <li><i>contextroot</i>/servlet/BirtReportServlet
      <li><i>contextroot</i>/servlet/WSDLResourceServlet

<h2><a name="customjar_deploy">Deploying custom class files</a></h2>
<p>In certain instances, such as creating custom listeners, deploying custom class files is required.
This is accomplished by adding your class files to the com.soa.repository.custom.jar (/) 
following the instructions above in the "Customize the com.soa.repository.custom.jar" topic.
You'll need to ensure the package information is preserved in the class file's path.  
For instance, suppose you have a class named <code>com.example.CustomListener</code>.  
It will need to be added to the com.soa.repository.custom.jar file as <code>/com/example/CustomListener.class</code>.  Here is an example of the required steps:
<ol>
<li>Create a directory called <code>/tmp/com/example</code>
<li>Copy the class file to the <code>/tmp/com/example</code> directory
<li>cd to the <code>/tmp</code> directory
<li>Run the following to update the deployed com.soa.repository.custom.jar with the new directory structure containing the new class file(s).
<pre>jar uvf {platform_home}/instances/{instance_name}/deploy/com.soa.repository.custom.jar com/example/CustomListener.class</pre>
...as an alternative to using the above <code>jar uvf</code> command, you could unzip the com.soa.repository.custom.jar file to a temp directory, add the relevant <code>com/example/CustomListener.class</code>
	structure, then zip it backup (making sure to preserve the directory structure)...
</ol>

<p>Some custom classes are cached by the application in the database so, when replacing a custom listener class with an updated version, 
it's best to reload the LPC in any libraries where your custom listeners will run. See the commands GetCurrentProcessConfiguration and 
SetProcessConfiguration in the <a href="#admincmd">Commands</a> section of this document.

<h2><a name="utf8">Saving files in UTF-8</a></h2>
<p>One needs to be concerned 
  with saving files that have non-ASCII characters. There are several different 
  encodings that one can use to safely preserve extended characters (UTF-16, UTF-8, 
  etc). Lifecycle Manager use UTF-8 encoding in various places throughout the application. 
  Most of these issues should be transparent to the end-user, but some should 
  be noted. Whereever input takes the form of an XML file, the XML 
  file has a declaration for specifying the encoding. Even if it is not specified, 
  the default encoding is UTF-8 and the document will be interpreted as being 
  encoded as such. It is recommended to leave this set to UTF-8 and ensure that 
  your file is saved in UTF-8. 
<p>Most XML files displayed to the user will be preserved as UTF-8 if they are 
  saved using the browser's File -&gt; Save As option. Do not copy and paste this 
  text from the browser to a text editor unless you know the text will be preserved 
  as UTF-8 encoded without a BOM (byte-order mark). 
<p>Also, if overviews are uploaded using Automation Extensions, they should be encoded using UTF-8 .
<p>It is very easy to mess up a file by saving it in the incorrect encoding. Therefore 
  these instructions should be used anytime you save a file containing non-ASCII 
  characters. 
<ul>
  <li><b>Notepad:</b> Choose the File menu, then Save As. Under the Encoding dropdown, 
    select UTF-8 and save the file. 
  <li><b>WordPad:</b> WordPad does not handle UTF-8 encodings, use Notepad instead. 
    WordPad does have a Unicode option, but unfortunately this is UTF-16, not 
    UTF-8. 
  <li><b>Vim:</b> Some UNIX systems have an enhanced version of VI installed called 
    Vim. Use the command ":set encoding=utf-8" when saving your file. 
  <li><b>Visual Studio:</b> Choose the File menu, then Advanced Save Option. In 
    the Encoding dropdown, select Unicode (UTF-8 <b>without</b> signature) - Codepage 
    65001. 
</ul>

<h2><a name="userlicensereport">User License Report</a></h2>
<p>A User License Report is included which you may link to in an appropriate group 
   of your choice. The report provides a list of all users on the installation and
   the libraries to which each user has access. Create the report link as follows:
   <ol>
     <li>Log into a library as a Usage Controller
     <li>From the Home page, click Manage Reports
     <li>Click Add Report for an appropriate group or project where you would like all users to see this report link
     <li>Enter a meaningful name and description
     <li>Enter the URL: {your server host}/lm/birt/run?__report=/reports/AdminUserLicense.rptdesign&amp;database_schema_name=
     <li>Note: the value for the database_schema_name parameter is optional unless you connect to the database as a user other than the schema owner.
   </ol>

 <h2><a name="managereports">Managing Reports</a></h2>
<p>Customers may use the BIRT Eclipse tool to create custom reports and deploy those reports to the application server to be available to application
users. Beginning in RM and PortM 6.3.1, BIRT reports are managed using the Configuration Designer plug-in. The report design files appear in your 
configuration project under Document-Source -> reports. Custom reports may be saved to this folder and uploaded to the library via the context menu.
Once a report has been uploaded to the library, follow the steps below to create the report link.
<br> <br>
 For version 6.7 installations, follow these steps once a report is ready to deploy:
 <ol>
    <li>Be sure to replace the datasource property in your report design with the datasource used in Akana's standard reports. Compare the XML 
        report designs for details.
 </ol>
<p>
   Create the report link as follows:
   <ol>
     <li>Log into a library as a Usage Controller
     <li>From the Home page, click Manage Reports
     <li>Click Add Report for an appropriate group or project where you would like all users to see this report link
     <li>Enter a meaningful name and description
     <li>Enter the URL: {your server host}/{context root}/birt/run?__report=/reports/{your report name}&amp;database_schema_name=
     <li>Note: the value for the database_schema_name parameter is optional unless you connect to the database as a user other than the schema owner.
   </ol>
