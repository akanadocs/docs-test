<p>Information about the authorization roles needed for running the Akana API Platform API.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: the information in this article relates to authorization roles specifically for running the API platform API. For information about the authorization roles for platform users, within the developer portal itself, see <a href="../../learnmore/bus_admin_organizations.htm#business_roles_default" target="_blank">What are the default roles for the API platform?</a> (developer portal help).</p>

</ul>



<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Some operations can be performed even if a user is not logged in to the platform, such as viewing certain types of content. Other operations, such as adding an app, require login.</p>
<p>In some cases, activities are further restricted so that certain operations can only be performed by a member of a certain user group or group. For details about these scenarios, see <a href="#access_private">Access to Private Resources and Content</a> below.</p>
<p>Certain roles, such as the Site Admin or Business Admin, have a senior level of access to multiple resources.</p>
<p>The default authorization roles used by the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Akana API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API are listed and explained below.</p>
<p>In a case where the user sending an API request has insufficient authorization, there are two possible results:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If an API call doesn't meet the necessary authorization role criteria&#8212;for example, the operation requires Business Admin permission and the user is not a Business Admin&#8212;it fails, with an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response.</li>
	<li>If a user doesn't have the required access to a private resource, the operation runs successfully, returning an HTTP code 200, but information relating to the private resource is not returned. Depending on the scenario, the response might include a subset of information or might not contain any information at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation for each operation includes information on the authorization roles that are required to run the operation.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The authorization roles specified are platform defaults. Roles are configurable; a specific installation might include customization of roles.</li>
	<li>For a high-level summary of all roles, see <a href="../../learnmore/bus_admin_organizations.htm#business_roles_default" target="_blank">What are the default roles for the API platform?</a> (developer portal help). The table below addresses roles specifically in the context of using the platform API.</li>

<h3 id="access_private">Access to Private Resources and Content</h3>
<p>Some operations can be performed even if a user is not logged in to the platform, such as viewing certain types of content. However, when resources are marked as Private, a user doesn't see those resources even if an operation doesn't require login. For any resources or content with additional access restrictions applied to it, a user must meet additional requirements before seeing the resource or content. The operation will still run successfully, but the private results will not be returned.</p>
<p>For example, the <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="../apis/m_apis_listAPIs.htm">GET&nbsp;/api/apis</a></span> operation returns a list of all APIs on the platform. For a user invoking this operation, it returns a list of all public APIs and any additional APIs for which the user has access, providing the user is logged in. Private APIs to which the user doesn't have access do not appear on the list.</p>
<p>Another examples is the <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="../content/m_content_get.htm">GET&nbsp;/content/get</a></span> operation, which returns content. If the content being requested relates to a Private API and is marked as private, the content is not returned unless the user is authorized to have access to the content. In some cases a Private API might have some content designated as Private and some designated as Public. In this case, the public content is returned to all users, but the private content is not.</p>
<h5>Private API Access</h5>
<p>If an API version is private, it can be seen only by a user who has one of the following roles:</p>
<ul>
	<li>API Administrator</li>
	<li>Business Administrator</li>
	<li>Site Administrator</li>
  
	<li>Invited users (includes API Scope Group members and members of additional groups invited by the Private API Administrator)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Private App Access</h5>
<p>If an app version is private, it can be seen only by a user who has one of the following roles:</p>
<ul>
	<li>App team member</li>
	<li>Business Admin</li>
	<li>Site Admin</li>
</ul>

<h5>Private Group Access</h5>
<p>To view information relating to a group that's designated as Private, a user must have one of the following roles:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Group Administrator (for an API Scope Group, the API Administrator)</li>
	<li>Group member</li>
	<li>Group leader</li>
	<li>Site Admin</li>
	<li>Business Admin</li>
</ul>
