<h1 id="top">HTTP Status Codes</h1>
<p>HTTP status codes break down into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
	<li>100-199: Informational messages</li>
	<li>200-200: The message was successful</li>
	<li>300-399: Redirection</li>
	<li>400-415: Error on the client side</li>
	<li>500-599: Error on the server side</li>
</ul>
<p>Recognizing the general numeric category could be helpful in tracking down the source of an error.</p>
<p>The table below provides information on some of the more common HTTP error codes you might encounter when working with the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Akana API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API. For a full list of HTTP error code numbers and meanings, refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html" target="_blank">the HTTP spec</a>.</p>

		<tr>
			<td colspan="3"><strong>Success codes:</strong></td>
		</tr>

			<td id="http200">200</td>
			<td>OK</td>

			<td id="http201">201</td>
			<td>Created</td>
			<td>Successful create (add) request.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="http204">204</td>
			<td>No Content</td>
			<td>The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="3"><strong>Redirect codes:</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="http302">302</td>
			<td>Redirect</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="3"><strong>Client error codes:</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="http400">400</td>
			<td>Bad Request</td>
			<td>Returned if the client sends invalid parameters or body content. For example, you might get this response if there is a typo in the request URL, or if you send malformed XML in your request (if applicable).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="http401">401</td>
			<td>Unauthorized</td>
			<td><p>Authentication (login) is required for this operation. For example, perhaps a required cookie was not included.</p>
			<p>You would get this response if you didn't include the custom <a href="../Ref_Glossary_CommunityPlatform.htm#gl_xcsrf_token_fedmemberid">X-Csrf-Token_{fedmemberID}</a> header in the request, or if it was invalid or expired.</p></td>

			<td id="http403">403</td>
			<td>Forbidden</td>
			<td>Authentication is required.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="http404">404</td>
			<td>Resource not found</td>
			<td>The information in the path, parameters, or message header/body didn't match up to any available resource at the specified URL. For example, the message has the wrong content-type, a typo in a parameter, or a wrong accept-header; or you might get this error if a specified resource, such as an app, API, or rating, does not exist. You would also get this if you were using the wrong HTTP verb.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td id="http405">405</td>
		<td>Method Not Allowed</td>
		<td><p>The request is using an HTTP verb not supported for the resource (at that endpoint/URL).</p>
				<p>If the operation doesn't support the HTTP verb&#8212;for example, if POST is used but only GET is supported&#8212;the response includes an Allow header with a list of the HTTP methods (HTTP verbs) that are valid for the resource. For example, the following Allow header was returned for a POST operation that was attempted with a GET HTTP verb:</p>
				<pre>allow POST</pre></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="http406">406</td>
			<td>Unacceptable/Not acceptable</td>
			<td><p>Returned if the response format, as specified in the Accept header, does not match the content type specified in the request.</p>
				<p>For example, you might get this response if you set the Accept header to text/xml for an operation that only returns an application/json response, such as <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="../apis/m_apis_getFollowers.htm">GET&nbsp;/api/apis/{APIID}/followers</a></span>.</p>
				<p>It indicates that there is no format that the operation can return, that matches the format or formats specified in the Accept header. Therefore any possible response is &quot;not acceptable&quot; per the specification in the Accept header.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="http409">409</td>
			<td>Invalid action for current resource state</td>
			<td>The action attempted was not valid for the current state. For example, the message is attempting to cancel an API contract that doesn't currently have a status of Approved.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="http415">415</td>
			<td>Unsupported Media Type</td>
			<td>Returned if the request is using a media type not supported by the method.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="3"><strong>Server error codes:</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td id="http500">500</td>
			<td>Internal Server Error</td>
			<td>An error occurred while processing the call. This error is generally returned for any business logic failure that doesn't fit into any of the defined categories above.</td>
