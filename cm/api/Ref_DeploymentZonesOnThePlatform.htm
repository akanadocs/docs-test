<h2><a name="top"></a>Deployment Zones on the Platform</h2>
<p>If an API is hosted on the platform and is using the proxy capability, the API owner can specify one or more deployment zones, such as a geographical area or a specific data center, that the endpoint will be proxied in. The <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="deploymentzones/m_deploymentzones_getDeploymentZones.htm">GET&nbsp;/api/deploymentzones</a></span> operation returns a list of deployment zones that are valid for the platform.</p>

<p>Any container or container cluster that can host APIs for the platform instance can be defined as a deployment zone. If deployment zones are not configured, any valid container or container cluster is identified as a possible deployment zone and is therefore available to someone adding an API on the platform.</p>
<p>Configuring deployment zones allows you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limit the containers or container clusters that are available for platform APIs, so that the APIs can only use those that you specify are available. When you define deployment zones, only those that are defined are valid choices when adding an API to the platform. You might have other containers or container clusters that you donât want to use for platform APIs. Defining deployment zones protects those from use by platform APIs.</li>
  <li>Limit a specific container or container cluster for use only as a sandbox endpoint or only as a production endpoint. When you define deployment zones, you specify whether it is available for sandbox, production, or both.</li>
  <li>Define a virtual host. A Network Director HTTP or HTTPS listener only has one hostname, but you could configure deployment zones to show a different hostname, a virtual hostname. This is useful in scenarios where the API needs to be published with a specific hostname, independently of where it is deployed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: At this time, there is no interface to manage deployment zones in the platform. If no deployment zones are configured, the platform API constructs transient deployment zones based on the deployment configuration of the agents available for the platform to host API proxy endpoints. To manage the deployment zones in the platform, contact tech support.</p>
