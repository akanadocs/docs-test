<h2><a name="top"></a>Authorization Roles on the Platform</h2>
<p>Some operations can be performed even if a user is not logged in to the platform, such as viewing certain types of content. Other operations, such as adding an app, require login.</p>
<p>In other cases, activities are further restricted so that certain operations can only be performed by a member of a certain user group or group. For details about these scenarios, see <a href="#access_private">Access to Private Resources and Content</a> below.</p>
<p>Certain roles, such as the business administrator, have a senior level of access to multiple resources.</p>
<p>The authorization roles used by the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API are listed and explained below. If an API call doesn't meet the necessary authorization role criteria it fails. If a user doesn't have the required access to a private resource, the operation runs successfully, returning an HTTP code 200, but information relating to the private resource is not returned. Depending on the scenario, the response might include a subset of information or might not contain any information at all.</p>
<p>The documentation for each operation includes information on the authorization roles that are required to run the operation.</p>
<p>Authorization role specification is prefaced by <strong>AuthorizationRole</strong>; for example, <strong>AuthorizationRole.USER</strong>.</p>

<h3><a name="access_private"></a>Access to Private Resources and Content</h3>
<p>Some operations can be performed even if a user is not logged in to the platform, such as viewing certain types of content. However, when resources are marked as Private, a user doesn't see those resources even if an operation doesn't require login. For any resources or content with additional access restrictions applied to it, a user must meet additional requirements before seeing the resource or content. The operation will still run successfully, but the private results will not be returned.</p>
<p>For example, the <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="apis/m_apis_listAPIs.htm">GET&nbsp;/api/apis</a></span> operation returns a list of all APIs on the platform. For a user invoking this operation, it returns a list of all public APIs and any additional APIs for which the user has access, providing the user is logged in. Private APIs to which the user doesn't have access do not appear on the list.</p>
<p>Another examples is the <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="content/m_content_get.htm">GET&nbsp;/content/get</a></span> operation, which returns content. If the content being requested relates to a Private API and is marked as private, the content is not returned unless the user is an authorized user. In some cases a Private API might have some content designated as Private and some designated as Public. In this case, the public content is returned to all users, but the private content is not.</p>
<h5>Private API Access</h5>
<p>If an API version is private, it can be seen only by a user who has one of the following roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>API Administrator</li>
  <li>Business Administrator</li>
  <li>Sie Administrator</li>
  
  <li>Invited users (includes Private API Group members and members of additional groups invited by the Private API Administrator)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Private App Access</h5>
<p>If an app version is private, it can be seen only by a user who has one of the following roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>App team member</li>
  <li>Business Administrator</li>
  <li>Sie Administrator</li>
</ul>

<h5>Private Group Access</h5>
<p>To view information relating to a group that's designated as Private, a user must have one of the following roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Group Administrator (for a Private API Group, the API Administrator)</li>
  <li>Group member</li>
  <li>Group leader</li>
  <li>Site Administrator</li>
  <li>Business Administrator</li>
</ul>
