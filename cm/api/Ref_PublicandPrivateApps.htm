<h2><a name="top"></a>Public and Limited (Private) Apps</h2>
<p>The <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;supports three visibility scenarios that affect who can see information about, and interact with, your app:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Public</strong>: a public app can be seen by all&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;users, whether registered or not. Communications relating to a public app, such as tickets and discussions, might be picked up and rendered by popular search engines. Changes to the app are still restricted to app team members, but the app has general visibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Private</strong>: if an app is private, it can only be seen by members of the specific app team. Invited members don't see the app until they accept the invitation. With private apps, content relating to the app, such as tickets and discussions, is not accessible to public search engines, although it is indexed and rendered by the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;internal search facility. In the API, this visibility option is represented by the following value: <strong>Limited</strong>. </li>
  <li><strong>Registered Users</strong>: If an app has this visibility setting, it is visible to all platform users who are logged in, but not visible to anonymous users. In the API, this visibility option is represented by the following value: <strong>com.soa.visibility.registered.users</strong>.</li>
</ul>
