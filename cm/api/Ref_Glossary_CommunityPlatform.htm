<h2><a name="top"></a>Glossary of Terms</h2>
<p>Definitions for some of the terms used by the platform API.</p>
<dl class="apidoc_dl">


<dt><a name="gl_ajax"></a>Ajax</dt>
<dd>An abbreviation for <strong>Advanced JavaScript and XML</strong>&#8212;A term for a set of related web development techniques that can be used together to update parts of a webpage without reloading the entire page. For an example of how the platform works with Ajax, see <a href="Ref_FileUploadWithAjax.htm">File Upload with Ajax</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_alert"></a>alert</dt>
<dd>A type of <a href="#gl_dashboardentry">Dashboard item</a> designed to inform app or API administrators about an issue such as an SLA (Service Level Agreement) violation.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_anonymoususer"></a>anonymous user</dt>
<dd>A user who is browsing the platform without logging in.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_api"></a>API</dt>
<dd>A key resource in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->. An API provides a business with a way of using the Internet to extend business capabilities to connect with new customers in new ways. In this context an API is a Web service exposed outside the enterprise, typically using RESTful design principles, and often with JSON content.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_apiaccessrequest"></a>API access request</dt>
<dd>A specific type of <a href="#gl_connectionrequest">Connection Request</a>. An API access request governs the relationship between an app and an API for the life of the connection. When an app team member requests a connection to an API on behalf of the app, the API administrator is notified of the pending request and can respond accordingly. The administrator's action to either approve or deny the request changes the <a href="#gl_state">state</a> of the connection.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_apiadmin"></a>API Administrator</dt>
<dd>One of the <a href="#gl_role">roles</a> defined in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;is that of the API Admin. Each API must have at least one Admin, and can have more. The API Admin approves or rejects connection requests, moderates the API's <a href="#gl_board">Board</a>, views and manages alerts and trouble tickets, and manages documents, policies, and other information associated with the API. The API Admin can also view performance and usage data for the entire API, and can invite others to be Admins for the same API. For more information, see <a href="Ref_ManagingGroupsOnThePlatform.htm#groups_apiadmin">Managing Groups on the Platform</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_app"></a>app</dt>
<dd>An app (application) is a piece of software that delivers specific capabilities to its users. In the context of the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, an app is a piece of software that consumes one or more APIs.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_appteammember"></a>app team member</dt>
<dd>One of the <a href="#gl_role">roles</a> defined in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;is that of the app team member. Each app most have at least one team member and can have more. An app team member initiates contract requests, such as API access requests, moderates the app's <a href="#gl_board">Board</a>, and views and manages trouble tickets relating to the app. The app team member can also view performance and usage data for the app's API usage, and can invite others to be team members for the same app. All app team members have the same rights. For more information, see <a href="Ref_ManagingGroupsOnThePlatform.htm#groups_appteam">Managing Groups on the Platform</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_appid"></a>AppID</dt>
<dd>When a user registers an app in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;platform, the app is assigned an AppID. The AppID is the unique identifier for the app within the platform. All API calls include the AppID.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_archivable"></a>archivable</dt>
<dd>A flag used for internal purposes to track whether a Board item can be deleted without impacting other functionality. If an item is archivable, it can be deleted. If it is not archivable, deleting it could potentially impact the user experience. For example, if a user has a group membership invitation, and the Board item is deleted, the invitor could change the invitation, and there would be no way for the user to see the update without the original Board item.</dd>
<dd>If administrators are writing purge functionality for board items, it's important to make sure that only Board items with the archivable flag set to <strong>true</strong> are purged.</dd>
<dd>You might see this value in an RSS feed response to some operations relating to the Board for a resource, or to a user's home feed; for example, <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="apis/m_apis_getBoard.htm">GET&nbsp;/api/apis/{APIID}/board</a></span>.</dd>



<dt>Assertion</dt>
<dd>See <a href="#gl_saml_assertion">SAML assertion</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_saml_acs"></a>Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) endpoint</dt>
<dd>In <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a>, the endpoint where the service provider will receive SAML assertions from the identity provider.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_saml_ars"></a>Artifact Resolution Service (ARS)</dt>
<dd>In <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a>, a service that you must set up if you want to use the HTTP Artifact binding (supported for single sign-on SAML response messages). You can then use the service to retrieve the full message using the artifact. See <a href="#gl_saml_http_artifact">HTTP Artifact</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_oauth_authorizationendpoint"></a>Authorization endpoint (OAuth)</dt>
<dd>Users connect to the authorization endpoint; apps connect to the <a href="#gl_oauth_tokenendpoint">token endpoint</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_authorization"></a>Authorization header</dt>
<dd>The Authorization request header contains the username and password. It's sent by the client, to authenticate the client with the server. A client includes this header in its request after receiving a 401 Authentication Required response from the server. The Authorization header includes the authorization scheme and the authorization value.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_autoconnect"></a>auto-connect</dt>
<dd>An API setting that allows a contract to be created automatically with the API when a new app is created. The auto-connect feature can be specified per <a href="#gl_environment">environment</a> and can also be limited to specific <a href="#gl_license">licenses</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_avatar"></a>avatar</dt>
<dd>Within the platform, an avatar is an image that can be associated with a resource such as an app, API, user, or Private API Group.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_saml_base_url"></a>Base URL</dt>
<dd>In setting up the <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a> identity provider in Policy Manager, the platform provides a specific URL to be used for instances where the Identity Provider, when encountering an error, returns the error response to the default Service Provider endpoint rather than just showing the error on the authentication page. PingFederate is an example of an Identity Provider that returns an error response in this way.</dd>
<dd>To construct the endpoint to be used for error responses, the platform needs to know the &lt;protocol_scheme&gt;://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt; of the container where the SAML Web SSO domain is initialized. This is the base URL.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_board"></a>Board</dt>
<dd>In the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, every resource, such as an app or API, has a Board that displays all feed entries for the resource. Users with approved connections to the resource can post items to the resource's Board according to privileges. For example, a member of a specific app team can post items to the Board for that app. Users with approved connections also see relevant Board items in their personal home Feed.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_boarditem"></a>Board item</dt>
<dd>An individual entry on a resource's <a href="#gl_board">Board</a>. A Board item can be an <a href="#gl_alert">Alert</a>, <a href="#gl_apiaccessrequest">API Access Request (Contract Request)</a>, <a href="#gl_discussion">Discussion</a>, <a href="#gl_membershiprequest">Group Membership Invitation</a>, or <a href="#gl_ticket">Ticket</a>. It can also be an item on a <a href="#gl_customboardid">custom board</a>.</dd>
<dd>A <a href="#gl_review">review</a> is also a type of Board item; however, in the platform user interface a review isn't included as part of the object's Board. Instead, reviews are included in the user interface as part of the details page for the object (app, API, or group). In terms of using the API, all operations that work for Board items work for reviews also.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_business"></a>business</dt>
<dd>In the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, a business is an entity that owns and publishes one or more APIs.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_businessadmin"></a>Business Administrator</dt>
<dd>One of the roles defined in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;is that of the <a href="Ref_AuthorizationRolesOnThePlatform.htm#authroles_bizadmin">Business Administrator</a>. A business can own one or more APIs and apps, and must have at least one Administrator. The Business Administrator automatically has administrator rights over all the APIs and apps owned by the business as well as all the users who are part of the business. For more information, see <a href="Ref_ManagingGroupsOnThePlatform.htm#groups_bizadmin">Managing Groups on the Platform</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_cache"></a>cache</dt>
<dd>When an HTTP message is sent and a response received, the client has the capability of caching the response. The response must therefore define whether the response content should be cached or not, via the Cache-Control response header. In the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, responses should never be cached, so the value is <strong>no-cache</strong>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_captcha"></a>captcha</dt>
<dd>A visual challenge/response test used to maintain login security and help protect against security breaches. The test is designed to ensure that there is in fact a human logging in, not an automated process trying to break the password security.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_challengequestion"></a>challenge question</dt>
<dd>A question that the Business Admin chooses as part of a security feature. When signing up to the platform, the user must provide the answer to one or more security questions, if the platform is set up to require them. The user's answers are stored in the database, and the user must answer one or more security questions on demand to perform certain functions such as resetting a password or changing the user profile.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_cname"></a>CNAME</dt>
<dd>Abbreviation for Canonical Name. A CNAME identifies a unique domain name registered in the Domain Name System (DNS); for example, www.acmepayments.com. The domain name is mapped to an IP address.</dd>
<dd>When adding an API, the API definition includes CNAME, which is the hostname part of the URL which will be visible to app developers for the API. Typically you would register a CNAME (such as api.acmepayments.com) in your DNS for your API and then map it to the proxy hostname provided to you during signup (typically acmepayments.broker.soa.com).</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_apivisibility_complete"></a>complete API visibility</dt>
<dd>The app developer has full visibility of the API, including all operations and all API documentation.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_comment"></a>comment</dt>
<dd>A short piece of text that a logged-in user can associate with a resource, such as an app or API, for which the user has access rights. For example, a member of an app team can comment on discussions and reviews associated with the app.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_connectprovider"></a>Connect provider</dt>
<dd>In <a href="#gl_openidconnect">OpenID Connect</a>, the <a href="#gl_identityprovider">identity provider</a> is called the Connect provider.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_connection"></a>connection</dt>
<dd>A relationship between resources in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;&#8212;such as the API access relationship between an app and an API that it's using.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_connectionrequest"></a>connection request</dt>
<dd>A workflow process that governs the relationship between two resources for the life of the connection. It is a request to establish a <a href="#gl_connection">connection</a> between resources; for example, an <a href="#gl_apiaccessrequest">API access request</a><!-- or a <a href="#gl_followrequest">follow request</a>-->.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_container"></a>container</dt>
<dd>An SOA Software container instance performs a specific web service management function in an API Gateway deployment. Instances have a unique Instance Name, Description, and Listener configuration relative to the deployment requirements.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_content"></a>content</dt>
<dd>In the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, the term <em>content</em> refers to unstructured content uploaded by the user and displayed in the user interface, such as API documentation. The content is indexed by the Search feature. Only APIs and the platform itself have content; there is no content associated with other resources such as apps and groups.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_contract"></a>contract</dt>
<dd>A specific type of <a href="#gl_connection">connection</a> that defines a consumption relationship between an app and an API. When an app admin (app team member) wants the app to be able to consume an API, he/she initiates a request for API access. The API access relationship is a contract, and is subject to an approval workflow. The contract is requested by the app team member and is approved or rejected by the API admin; it can then be cancelled or suspended by the API admin or cancelled by an app team member.</dd>
<dd> The contract governs access rights and QoS (Quality of Service) policies for all transactions between the app and the API. It also provides a convenient way of collecting and presenting metrics and usage data.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_contractrequest"></a>contract request</dt>
<dd>A request for a <a href="#gl_contract">contract</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_coordinateduniversaltime"></a>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</dt>
<dd>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), also called Zulu time, is the primary time standard in general use. It essentially equates to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), but is more scientifically precise. In the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API, time values are represented in the standard UTC date/time format <strong>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ</strong>. Example: <strong>2013-12-31T15:45:00-04:00Z</strong>.</dd>
<dd>Epoch time, also called Unix time, is defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time, Thursday, 1 January 1970. In some cases we use this value in response messages, expressed in milliseconds.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_csrf_attack"></a>CSRF attack</dt>
<dd>In a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack, a malicious user exploits the fact that an authorized user has already authenticated with another site and has the site's cookie in their browser. Malicious code from one browser tab can leverage the authentication already granted in another tab to execute actions unknown to the authorized user.</dd>
<dd>The platform includes a feature to help prevent CSRF attacks. For more information, see <a href="Ref_CSRFPreventionOnThePlatform.htm">CSRF Prevention on the Platform</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_csrf_tokencookie"></a>Csrf-Token cookie</dt>
<dd>A platform cookie that is used only if the CSRF prevention feature is in effect. The value of the Csrf-Token cookie is sent as a custom header value in request messages to protect against CSRF attacks.  For more information, see <a href="Ref_CSRFPreventionOnThePlatform.htm">CSRF Prevention on the Platform</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_csv"></a>CSV</dt>
<dd>Comma-separated value format, a format commonly used for exporting tabular data. For example, in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, the <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="apps/m_apps_exportMetrics.htm">GET&nbsp;/api/apps/versions/{AppVersionID}/metrics/export</a></span><a href="apps/m_apps_exportMetrics.htm"></a> operation exports the metric information in CSV format.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_customboardid"></a>custom board ID</dt>
<dd>The platform supports creation of a custom Board upon request. The custom Board has a unique BoardID.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_dashboard"></a>Dashboard</dt>
<dd>The user's Dashboard, also called home page or feed, is the first page the user sees after logging in. The Dashboard includes information relating to apps and APIs the user is associated with. An individual user's Dashboard is an aggregation of all the Board items from all the resources that the user is following. An individual user can modify the types of information that are displayed on his/her Dashboard. See also <a href="#gl_dashboardentry">Dashboard entry</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_dashboardentry"></a>Dashboard entry/item</dt>
<dd>An informational item that appears on a user's Dashboard. The entries on a specific user's Dashboard are Board items for resources the user is following. A Dashboard entry can be any of the following: <a href="#gl_alert">Alert</a>, <a href="#gl_apiaccessrequest">API Access Request (Contract Request)</a>, <a href="#gl_discussion">Discussion</a>, <a href="#gl_membershiprequest">Group Membership Invitation</a>, or <a href="#gl_ticket">Ticket</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_developer"></a>developer</dt>
<dd>A developer of an app that will consume an API.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_policy_denialofservice"></a>denial of service policy</dt>
<dd><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/policy_denialofservice.lbi" -->A policy that defines conditions for protecting against, and/or dealing with, a Denial of Service attack.<!-- #EndLibraryItem --></dd>



<dt><a name="gl_policy_compliance"></a>compliance policy</dt>
<dd><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/policy_compliance.lbi" -->A policy that allows an organization to create standards that control the quality of the data in the repository. These policies can be used to analyze the service metamodel, WSDL documents, Schema, and transactional data to determine whether they meet corporate standards.<!-- #EndLibraryItem --></dd>



<dt><a name="gl_deploymentzone"></a>deployment zone</dt>
<dd>If an API is hosted on the platform and using the proxy capability, the API owner can specify one or more deployment zones, such as a geographical area or a specific data center, that the endpoint will be proxied in. The <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="deploymentzones/m_deploymentzones_getDeploymentZones.htm">GET&nbsp;/api/deploymentzones</a></span> operation returns a list of valid deployment zones.</dd>
<dd>For more information, refer to <a href="Ref_DeploymentZonesOnThePlatform.htm">Deployment Zones on the Platform</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_discussion"></a>discussion</dt>
<dd>In the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, an authorized user can create a discussion topic about a resource (app or API) on the resource's Board. A discussion is typically, but not necessarily, created by someone other than the owner or administrator of the resource. Discussion entries are not threaded; users comment on the original item rather than on the comments/replies to the original item. Users can, however, <a href="#gl_mark">mark</a> or <a href="#gl_unmark">unmark</a> the discussion itself and/or one or more discussion comments.</dd>
<dd>Each discussion has a title and one or more comments. The visibility of a discussion is controlled by the visibility of the resource it's associated with; for example, a discussion about a Limited (Private) API can only be seen by administrators and Private API Group members associated with that API.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_discussiontype"></a>discussion type</dt>
<dd>In an earlier version of the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, discussions were categorized in separate discussion types, such as Comment or Question. Discussion types are no longer in use. In certain cases, a DiscussionType parameter might still be returned in a response message; if so, it can be ignored.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_duration"></a>duration</dt>
<dd>The duration of a request or response message is expressed with the Duration data type in the format <strong>PnYnMnDTnHnMnS</strong>. For example, a message response time of <strong>P0Y0M0DT0H0M0.022S</strong> indicates 22 milliseconds. For an expanded definition of Duration, refer to <a href="Ref_API_Reference.htm#datatypes_duration">Data Types</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_saml_entity_id"></a>Entity ID</dt>
<dd>In <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a>, a unique identifier for an entity. A SAML entity can be a Service Provider or an Identity Provider.</dd>
<dd>As a service provider, you define the Entity ID. When setting up your account with the Identity Provider you must specify the Entity ID, which must be unique within the IdP so that the IdP can identify your Service Provider.</dd>
<dd>The Entity ID is used as the value of the &lt;Issuer&gt; element inside the SAML protocol message. In an authentication request, the
&lt;Issuer&gt; element contains the Entity ID of the Service Provider; in the SAML response, it has the Entity ID of the Identity Provider.</dd>
<dd>From the perspective of the Service Provider, the Entity ID is analogous to the client_id in OAuth.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_entityreferences"></a>entity references</dt>
<dd><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/define_entityreferences.lbi" -->When an HTTP GET operation in the platform returns information in the form of an RSS channel, it very often includes entity references. Where an RSS item represents an object, the entity references include additional information about the object. For example, if the RSS channel returns information about an app version, the entity reference might include information about the app to which the app version belongs. All relevant relationships to the object returned in the RSS response are represented in the entity references.<!-- #EndLibraryItem --></dd>



<dt><a name="gl_enum"></a>enumeration (of users)</dt>
<dd>The term user enumeration, user enum, or simply enum refers to a security vulnerability that allows an unauthorized user to compile a list of valid user accounts that are authorized to log in to an application. For example, if an unauthorized user can try to sign up with an existing email address, and the application returns a message that an account already exists for that email address, the application is giving away information.</dd>
<dd>The platform includes enhanced security settings that can be activated to help prevent enumeration of users.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_environment"></a>environment</dt>
<dd>Ap app/API contract can apply either to the Sandbox environment, which is a testing area, or the production environment. See also <a href="Ref_Values.htm#values_contractenvironment">App/API Contract Environment Values</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_fdn"></a>FDN</dt>
<dd>The Fully Distinguished Name of a platform member. This applies to federated members. To uniquely identify an item across federation members, the Relative Distinguished Name (<a href="#gl_rdn">RDN</a>) is joined with the hosting federation member's name to create a Fully Distinguished Name (FDN).</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_federation"></a>federation</dt>
<dd>Two or more&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;<a href="#gl_tenant">tenants</a> who have unified to create a community in which APIs can be shared by users of both tenants.</dd>
<dd>The systems that participate in a federation (federation members, tenants) share information without requiring duplication of that information in each member and without relinquishing control of the information. Developers who sign up as users of one federation member can access information from a second federation member directly, without the need for signup or authentication by the second member. A federation setup requires the establishment of a trust relationship between federation members.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_federationmember"></a>federation member</dt>
<dd>An individual member of a <a href="#gl_federation">federation</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_feedentry"></a>feed entry</dt>
<dd>See <a href="#gl_dashboardentry">Dashboard entry</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_followrequest"></a>follow request</dt>
<dd>A specific type of <a href="#gl_connectionrequest">Connection Request</a> used to establish a "follow" relationship between a user and a <a href="#gl_resource">resource</a> that can be followed. Currently, only apps, APIs, and groups can be followed.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_group"></a>group</dt>
<dd>1) The term "group" is used in many instances to refer to any of the following types of groups in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;: app teams, Private API groups, API Administrator groups, Site Administrator groups, or independent groups.</dd>
<dd>2) &quot;Group&quot; is sometimes used specifically to mean a <a href="#gl_privateapigroup">Private API Group</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_groupadministrator"></a>group administrator</dt>
<dd>For an independent group on the platform, the administrator has greater rights than a <a href="#gl_leader">leader</a> or <a href="#gl_member">member</a>. For more information, see <a href="Ref_ManagingGroupsOnThePlatform.htm#groups_independentgroup">Managing Groups on the Platform</a>. For a <a href="#gl_privateapigroup">Private API Group</a>, the Administrator role is held by the API Adminstrator.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_guid"></a>GUID</dt>
<dd>Globally unique identifier for a resource (same as <a href="#gl_fdn">FDN</a>). For more information about unique IDs used by the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, see <a href="Ref_IDsOnThePlatform.htm">IDs on the Platform</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_gzip"></a>gzip</dt>
<dd>A standard encoding method sometimes used to compress HTTP request or response messages.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_hmac"></a>HMAC</dt>
<dd>The HMAC hashing algorithm uses a symmetric key to create a hash for message security. HMAC can be used with cryptographic hash algorithms such as MD5 or SHA-1.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_saml_http_artifact"></a>HTTP Artifact</dt>
<dd>One of the binding options supported by the <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a> protocol. HTTP Artifact is useful in scenarios where the SAML requester and responder are using an HTTP user-agent and do not want to transmit the entire message, either for technical or security reasons. Instead, a SAML Artifact is sent, which is a unique ID for the full information. The IdP can then use the Artifact to retrieve the full information. The artifact issuer must maintain state while the artifact is pending.</dd>
<dd>HTTP Artifact sends the artifact as a query parameter.</dd>
<dd>Community Manager currently supports this binding option for SAML responses, but not for SAML requests.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_saml_http_post"></a>HTTP POST</dt>
<dd>One of the binding options supported by the <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a> protocol.</dd>
<dd>HTTP POST sends the message content as a POST parameter, in the payload.</dd>
<dd>Community Manager currently supports this binding option for SAML, for both requests and responses.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_saml_http_redirect"></a>HTTP Redirect</dt>
<dd>One of the binding options supported by the <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a> protocol.</dd>
<dd>When HTTP Redirect is used, the service provider redirects the user to the identity provider where the login happens, and the identity provider redirects the user back to the service provider. HTTP Redirect requires intervention by the User-Agent (the browser).</dd>
<dd>Community Manager currently supports this binding option for SAML requests.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_homepage"></a>home page</dt>
<dd>A user who signs up to the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;has a customized <a href="#gl_dashboard">Dashboard</a> which is that user's home page&#8212;the first page the user sees when logging in. A user who hasn't signed up doesn't have a home page.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_icapserver"></a>ICAP server</dt>
<dd>Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) is a protocol that is sometimes used to extend a transparent proxy server for HTTP services. One common usage is to designate an ICAP server that provides virus scanning services.</dd>
<dd>The anti-virus policy provided by the platform's underlying infrastructure allows designation of an ICAP server that will provide anti-virus functionality. Once the policy is in place, messages are routed to the ICAP server, scanned, and forwarded only if they pass the scan.</dd>


<dt><a name="gl_identity_app"></a>identity (app)</dt>
<dd><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/parm_Identity_app.lbi" -->When adding an app version, you can specify a custom identity name for the app version. If no custom value is specified, in response messages this property defaults to the reverse of the RuntimeID, with a dash. For example, if the RuntimeID is <strong>123456.acmepayments</strong>, the value for the Identity property would be <strong>open-123456</strong>.<!-- #EndLibraryItem --></dd>



<dt><a name="gl_identityprovider"></a>identity provider</dt>
<dd>An identity provider (sometimes abbreviated as IdP) is an entity responsible for verifying identity and issuing identity information, usually in the form of a token. A common example is a website that allows users to log in using a Facebook or Google identiy; in this scenario, Facebook and Google are identity providers. In <a href="#gl_openidconnect">OpenID Connect</a>, the identity provider is called the Connect provider.</dd>
<dd>In terms of <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a>, the identity provider verifies the identity of the user in response to a request by the Service Provider, and then responds with a SAML assertion.</dd>

<dt><a name="gl_licenseterm"></a>license term</dt>
<dd>A license term is a rule that associates a set of <a href="#gl_qospolicy">QoS</a> policies with a set of <a href="#gl_scope">scopes</a> within a license. For example, let's say a user wants a license that supports Unlimited access to READ, but no more than 10 requests per day for ADD/MODIFY/DELETE combined. In this example, two terms would be part of the license. One term has three scopes, ADD/MODIFY/DELETE with a QoS policy of 10 requests per day, and the second term has one scope, READ with a QoS policy of Unlimited. This license could be assigned to the application.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_app_limited"></a>limited-visibility app</dt>
<dd><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/define_visibility.lbi" -->
There are two visibility settings for an app: <strong>public</strong> and <strong>limited</strong>.

<dd>For more information on domains in general, see <a href="Ref_ManagingDomainsOnThePlatform.htm">Managing Domains on the Platform</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_mark"></a>mark</dt>
<dd>Users can give positive feedback to items such as discussion topics and associated comments, reviews, and other resources such as tickets, using the <strong>Mark</strong> function. Choosing Mark provides positive feedback, in the same way as &quot;Like&quot; in Facebook&reg;. The Mark value toggles on and off, so a user can mark or <a href="#gl_unmark">unmark</a> a comment. In the user interface, the <strong>mark</strong> icon is a thumbs-up, and the <strong>unmark</strong> icon is a closed fist.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_member"></a>member</dt>
<dd>In the context of a <a href="#gl_privateapigroup">Private API Group</a>, a group member has access to all information relating to the Private API and the group, including tickets and discussions.

<dd>When a user first receives a notification, the notification state is <strong>Unread</strong>. Other valid notification states are: <strong>Read</strong>, <strong>Archived</strong>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_oauth"></a>OAuth</dt>
<dd>OAuth is a popular Web security protocol that enables a user to grant permission to a third-party application to access the user's Web resources without sharing passwords or personal information. The third-party application first facilitates a connection to the holder of the Web resources so that the user can log in and approve the access. For example, User A could allow Site B, a subscription-only online training site, to have access to Account C, the user's credit card account, by authorizing a monthly debit of $25. User A would first sign in and approve the monthly debit. Site B could complete subsequent monthly debits without further interaction with User A; however, User A could cancel the access at any time. OAuth has been likened to a valet key on a car which gives access to certain features of the car without giving full access.</dd>
<dd>Essentially, OAuth allows a web-based or mobile application to use an API exposed by another web or mobile application without sharing passwords.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_openid"></a>OpenID</dt>
<dd>OpenID is an open standard for authenticating users. It can be used for access control and allows users to log on to different services with the same digital identity where these services trust the authentication body. OpenID simplifies the authentication process because there is only one username and password to remember. For more information, refer to the Site Admin help.</dd>
<dd>Since Google has now deprecated  OpenID support and OpenID Connect is being adopted by the industry, it is better to switch to <a href="#gl_openidconnect">OpenID Connect</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_openidconnect"></a>OpenID Connect</dt>
<dd>An identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol that allows the client to verify the identity of an end-user based on authentication by an authorization server. OpenID Connect was released in February 2014 and is gaining popularity. For example, Google is moving from OpenID to OpenID Connect for products such as the Google+ API, used by the platform's Google login domain.

<dt><a name="gl_pki"></a>public key integration (PKI)</dt>
<dd>When a user registers an app in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, the Shared Secret security option is the default. App owners who want to use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for secure message signing must specify Public Key Integration as the security option in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;user interface, on the App Details page.</dd>
<dd>To implement PKI, the app owner must get a public/private key pair, upload the public key to the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, and use the private key for signing the API requests. The&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API verifies each incoming request using the public key.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_publicprofile_app"></a>public profile (app)</dt>
<dd>An app's Public Profile screen allows the app owner to brand the content of the OAuth Authorization screen. It is presented to external end-users of an app, and is used to grant an app rights to use an API. The OAuth Authorization screen applies to both Public and Private apps.</dd>

<dt><a name="gl_review"></a>review</dt>
<dd>Users can write reviews for any resources to which they have access, such as apps and APIs. A review is actually a <a href="#gl_boarditem">Board item</a> even though, in the user interface, reviews are not displayed on the Board for the app or API, but instead are displayed on the Details page.</dd>
<dd>A review is actually a <a href="#gl_boarditem">Board item</a> even though, in the user interface, reviews are not displayed on the Board for the resource, but instead are displayed on the details page for the object (app, API, or group). In terms of using the API, all operations that work for Board items work for reviews also.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_role"></a>role</dt>
<dd>Within a <a href="#gl_privateapigroup">Private API Group</a>, each group member has a role, either as <a href="#gl_member">Member</a> or <a href="#gl_leader">Leader</a>. The Private API Admin cam invite team members and designate roles.</dd>

<dt><a name="gl_rsa"></a>RSA</dt>
<dd>A popular and secure  public key cryptography algorithm.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_rss"></a>RSS</dt>
<dd>RSS is a widely used technology that allows users to subscribe to website content they're interested in. Once users subscribe to RSS feeds, updated content is automatically delivered to them in the form of an <a href="#gl_rsschannel">RSS channel</a>, without the users having to check the individual websites for updates.</dd>
<dd>In the context of the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, many GET&nbsp;operations return the results in the format of an RSS channel. For more information, see <a href="Ref_RSSChannelsOnThePlatform.htm">RSS Channels on the Platform</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_rsschannel"></a>RSS channel</dt>
<dd>The format in which information is conveyed using the RSS technology is called an RSS feed, web feed, RSS channel, or RSS document. It includes full or summarized text plus metadata (information about the text).</dd>
<dd>Many of the operations in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API use RSS in the response. In general, GET&nbsp;methods that return any type of list return the information as an RSS channel, usually in either JSON or XML format as specified in the request message.</dd>
<dd>For more information on how the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;uses RSS channels, see <a href="Ref_RSSChannelsOnThePlatform.htm">RSS Channels on the Platform</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_sameoriginpolicy"></a>same-origin policy</dt>
<dd>Most browsers enforce the "same origin policy" security policy, which means that the parent window and an iframe can communicate only if they have the same domain name.

<dt><a name="gl_saml"></a>SAML</dt>
<dd>Acronym for Security Assertion Markup Language. SAML is an identity federation standard that enables single sign-on. It is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between a <a href="#gl_saml_service_provider">service provider</a> (providing a service to the user) and an <a href="#gl_identityprovider">identity provider</a> (providing user identity verification for the service provider).</dd>
<dd>One usage, in the context of the platform, is by OpenID Connect where it is used to provide single sign-on. The plaform acts as the <a href="#gl_relyingparty">relying party</a>.</dd>


<dt><a name="gl_saml_artifact"></a>SAML Artifact</dt>
<dd>A unique ID used by the service provider and identity provider to reference a specific user session or transaction. The SP can use the Artifact to query the IdP for information about the user.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_saml_assertion"></a>SAML assertion</dt>
<dd>A <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a> assertion is an XML document returned by the Identity Provider to the Service Provider after authentication of the user. The assertion has a very specific structure, as defined by the SAML standard. A SAML assertion has a &lt;Subject&gt; element which contains information about the user. It might have conditions and attributes associated with the information being conveyed. It is digitally signed and asserts that the user has been authenticated.</dd>
<dd>Note: the above definition applies to an authentication assertion, which applies in the context of the platformâs support of SAML. There are other types of SAML assertions.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_saml_web_sso"></a>SAML Web SSO</dt>
<dd>Single sign-on over the Web using the <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a> protocol.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_scope"></a>scope</dt>
<dd>A scope value for an API version defines a subset of resources to which permission can be independently granted. In addition, the permission granted can be controlled by visibility (permission to view) or access (permission to send messages, to either the sandbox or production endpoint).</dd>
<dd>In earlier versions of the platform, access could only be granted per resource; either full API access, or no access. Defining scopes for an API allows the API administrator to control the granularity of API access granted to an app. When scopes are defined, app owners can request access to specific resources they want to access, and API owners can grant access to specific resources they want to share. </dd>
<dd>In the platform API, scopes are also called Resources. A ResourceID is a unique ID for a scope.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_scopemapping"></a>scope mapping</dt>
<dd>If an API is using the Licenses feature, scope mapping is the key to defining which portions of your API will be available for which licenses. The scopes and licenses themselves are defined by the Business Admin, but at the API level the API Admin determines which operations are assigned to which scopes. This in turn determines which licenses will be available to app developers requesting access to an API.</dd>
<dd>In the Enterprise API Platform API, scope mapping is specified using the <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="apis/m_apis_saveOperationResources.htm">PUT&nbsp;/api/apis/versions/{APIVersionID}/resources</a></span> operation.</dd>

<dt><a name="gl_saml_service_provider"></a>Service Provider</dt>
<dd>In terms of <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a>, the Service Provider (SP) offers a service to the user and allows the user to sign in by using SAML. When the user attempts to sign in, the SP sends a SAML authentication request to the Identity Provider (IdP). The IdP validates the request, authenticates the user, and creates a SAML assertion that represents the userâs identity and, in some cases, sends additional information about the user in the form of associated attributes. The SAML assertion is digitally signed and encrypted and then sent back to the service provider that initiated the request.</dd>
<dd>Identity federation software at the SP receives the assertion, verified the authenticity, decrypts, and shares the information with the application.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_sha1"></a>SHA-1</dt>
<dd>SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function, broadly used and trusted.</dd>
<dd>When you hash a value with SHA-1, the hash function returns a 160-bit string. This is the message digest. The value is hashed and sent with the message; at the receipt point, the value is hashed again, and the two hash values are compared. When the two hash values match, it is a secure, reliable indication that the message hasn't changed; the message at the receipt point is an accurate duplication of the message at the send point.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_sha256"></a>SHA-256</dt>
<dd>Part of the SHA-2 family of algorithms developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to succeed SHA-1. Each is named according to the number of bits in the output; so, whereas SHA-1 has 160 bits in the hash output, SHA-256 has 256.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_sharedsecret"></a>shared secret</dt>
<dd>When you register your app, the AppID and Shared Secret are automatically generated. The Shared Secret is a binary hashed value, generated within the secure environment of the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;and known only to you and to the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->.

<dd>Individual resources have a status which might include such items as open connection requests, open trouble tickets, number of active consumers, number of active discussions, and number of unresolved alerts. Different resources have different status items.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_swagger"></a>Swagger</dt>
<dd>A third-party tool provided by the platform for automatic generation of API reference documentation. Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services. It produces dynamically generated documentation from the information provided in the API definition. When a user defines an API, the structure is dynamically generated and added to a predefined Swagger template (<strong>resources.swg</strong>). The API Admin can then add title, description, implementation notes, and parameter information. The documentation displayed to the user is a blend of automatically generated content (<a href="#gl_swagger_resource">Swagger resource file</a>) and user-generated content (<a href="#gl_swagger_properties">Swagger properties file</a>).</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_swagger_properties"></a>Swagger properties file</dt>
<dd>Once the Swagger documentation is generated, the user can add comments and additional information. This information is stored in a Swagger properties file named {APIVersionID}.properties; for example, <strong>apiversion17171.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_productname_lowercase.lbi" -->
acmepayments<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->.properties</strong>. When a user views the API documentation in the platform, the user sees a merged combination of the automatically-generated Swagger <a href="#gl_swagger_resource">resource documentation</a> and the user-generated information stored in the Swagger properties file.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_swagger_resource"></a>Swagger resource file</dt>
<dd>The automatically-generated API documentation file generated by Swagger based on the API definition. See <a href="#gl_swagger">Swagger</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_tag"></a>tag</dt>
<dd>A tag is essentially a keyword or key phrase that's added to a piece of content, or information associated with a resource, to assist in search results. Several different types of resources can have tags assigned to them; for example, apps, APIs, groups, and tickets. Multiple tags are separated by commas.</dd>
<dd>For example, if an app is a movie general knowledge game, the app owner might assign tags of movie, game, general knowledge; or an API owner can add a category or product line to the metadata for certain APIs so those APIs will come up in search results for that term.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_targetapi"></a>target API</dt>
<dd>When defining an API on the platform, if an API is using the platform as a proxy, the TargetAPI is used to define the destination ("next-hop") endpoint for the API.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_targeturl"></a>target URL</dt>
<dd>The URL for the <a href="#gl_targetapi">target API</a>. The  target URL is the endpoint for the implementation; the destination (&quot;next-hop&quot;) endpoint for the API.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_tenant"></a>tenant</dt>
<dd>An individual member of a <a href="#gl_federation">federation</a>. Each tenant generally has its own look and feel.

<dt><a name="gl_ticket"></a>ticket</dt>
<dd>A type of feed entry, representing a trouble ticket created to raise an issue with a resource (app or API) or a connection. Tickets are typically created by a consumer of an API. Any member of the community can comment on a ticket, but it can only be marked as Resolved by the original creator or by an administrator of the target resource. For example, if Joe writes a ticket about an issue with the SkyBlue API, only Joe or the SkyBlue API Admin can mark the ticket as Resolved.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_tmodel"></a>tModel</dt>
<dd>Abbreviation for Technical Model. A tModel is a data structure that resembles a type of XML web service. tModel is a core component of <a href="#gl_uddi">UDDI</a>. A tModel represents a unique concept or construct, and is used to describe compliance with a specification, concept, category, identifier system, or shared design. Each tModel should include a URL to a document that describes the tModel in greater detail.</dd>

<dt><a name="gl_uddikey"></a>uddi key</dt>
<dd>Each entity in a <a href="#gl_uddi">UDDI</a> registry is assigned a key, which uniquely identifies that entity within the registry. Various parts of an API registered in the platform have unique UDDI keys assigned in Policy Manager; for example, the BindingKey and InterfaceKey.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_unmark"></a>unmark</dt>
<dd>To unmark a discussion, ticket, comment, or other resource means to remove a <a href="#gl_mark">mark</a> previously placed on the resource. In the user interface, the <strong>mark</strong> icon is a thumbs-up, and the <strong>unmark</strong> icon is a closed fist.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_apiaccess_unrestricted"></a>unrestricted API access</dt>
<dd>Unrestricted API access for an app means that the contract is not limited to a specific license. The app has full access to all operations of the API. Compare: <a href="#gl_apiaccess_restricted">restricted API access</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_user"></a>user</dt>
<dd>A person with a registered login ID to the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->. All users must complete the registration process so that the system can gather required information about them before granting access. Each user can choose to define a new username/password combination that will be managed within the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, or can leverage the integration of&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;with external security providers such as Facebook&reg; for authentication. By completing the signup process, each individual is assigned the role of User; users can then assume other roles, such as API Administrator or App team member.</dd>
<dd><strong>Note</strong>: To use the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API, users must sign up with the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;rather than using a third-party authentication provider.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_utc"></a>UTC</dt>

<dt><a name="gl_version"></a>version</dt>
<dd>Each <a href="#gl_app">app</a> or <a href="#gl_api">API</a> on the platform much have at least one version, and can have multiple versions. When a user creates an app or API on the platform, the first version is created automatically; when using the API it's important to complete both actions. If there is only one app or API version, deleting that version also deletes the app or API.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_viewer"></a>viewer</dt>
<dd>A Group that has a connection to a Private API. Members of the group have access to the Private API as long as the connection between the group and the API exists, and can see information about the Private API such as documentation and discussions. In future versions of the platform, the definition of Viewer might extend to individual users or businesses.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_visibility"></a>visibility</dt>
<dd>A setting that controls the types of users who can see an object, such as an app, API, group, license, or scope, and any associated items such as discussions and tickets. See below: <a href="#gl_visibility_api">visibility (API)</a> and <a href="#gl_visibility_app">visibility (app)</a>. For more information about visibility values, refer to <a href="Ref_Values.htm#values_visibilitysettings">Visibility Settings</a>.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_visibility_api"></a>visibility (API)</dt>
<dd>A setting that controls the types of users who can see an API and its associated items such as discussions and tickets. Possible values are <strong>Public</strong> or <strong>Limited</strong>. A discussion about a Limited (Private) API can only be seen by administrators and Private API Group members associated with that API. Members must be either invited to a Private API Group associated with the API or invited to be an Administrator for the API, and must then accept the invitation, before they even see the API in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_visibility_app"></a>visibility (app)</dt>
<dd>A setting that controls the types of users who can see an app and its associated items such as discussions and tickets. Possible values are Public, meaning that anyone can see information about the app, or Limited, meaning that only app team members can see it.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_workflowaction"></a>workflow action</dt>
<dd>Certain types of activities on the platform must be done in a specific sequence. These are often managed by workflows. Each workflow action changes the state of the resource. Some examples of workflow actions are: requesting or approving an API contract, sending a group membership invitation, or changing the status of a ticket.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_workflowdefinitionkey"></a>workflow definition key</dt>
<dd>A unique ID is assigned to each custom workflow when it's uploaded to the platform. Example: <strong>2597f44e-8f1c-4cc4-8019-69781dd1a0d8</strong>. The workflow definition key indicates the custom workflow that's specified as the default for settings governing a certain type of resource, such as apps, APIs, or groups.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_authenticate"></a>WWW-Authenticate response header</dt>
<dd >A standard HTTP response header used as part of the authentication process used in&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API calls. When the server receives the request message, it challenges the client for valid authentication via the WWW-Authenticate response header. The client returns the authentication information in an <a href="#gl_authorization">Authorization header</a>. The server validates the client information and then acts on the request message.</dd>



<dt><a name="gl_xcsrf_token_fedmemberid"></a>X-Csrf-Token_fedmemberID header</dt>
  <dd>A custom header used by the platform to protect against <a href="#gl_csrf_attack">CSRF</a> attacks. For more information, see <a href="Ref_CSRFPreventionOnThePlatform.htm">CSRF Prevention on the Platform</a>.</dd>
