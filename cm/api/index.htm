<h3><a name="gettingstarted"></a>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To get started with using the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API, follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Decide which services you need to use, and which methods (operations).</li>
  <li>Make sure the platform that your application is on (for example, .NET, iOS, or Android) supports the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Cookies</li>
      <li>HTTP 1.1 protocol</li>
      <li>HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE&nbsp;operations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Check whether any authentication is required. This will depend on the specific API operation.<br />
  <strong>Note</strong>: If you are invoking any&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;operation that requires authentication, you must first invoke the login API <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="login/m_login_login.htm">POST&nbsp;/api/login</a></span>) to get the authentication token. Once you have that, you can use it to invoke the other operations. The token is only valid for 30 minutes, so the application that's invoking the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;operation must renew the token, or get a new token, periodically.</li>
  <li>For each operation, refer to the documentation for detailed information about the request message format and expected response.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Additional resources for getting started:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>For more detailed information about logging in and managing the session cookie, refer to <a href="Ref_AuthenticationAndSecurity.htm">Authentication and Security with the Enterprise API Platform API</a>.</li>
  <li>For some example &quot;getting started&quot; scenarios, see <a href="Ref_API_Reference.htm#howto_list">&quot;how-to&quot; topics</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="usingtheapitomodify"></a>Using the API to Modify the Platform</h3>
<p>You can use the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API to help speed up tasks normally completed through the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;user interface, such as setting up your apps or APIs.</p>
<p>However, if you're running the API to make changes to the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;user interface it's very important that you check for successful results along the way, and that if necessary you undo actions that haven't successfully completed. You must make sure you restore the user interface to a good stable condition with regard to your data.</p>
<p>When you're done, remember to invoke the <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="login/m_login_logout.htm">POST&nbsp;/api/login/logout</a></span> API to log out.</p>
<p class="apidoc_backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
