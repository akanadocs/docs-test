<p>If you run into a problem, how can you get help? There are several resources available, including the API documentation, the  development team, and the user community.</p>
<h5>What do you want to read about?</h5>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note:</strong> The items below are not in any sequence or order of importance. You can use any resource for help at any time.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#searching">Searching Existing Resources</a></li>
  <li><a href="#writing">Writing a Ticket</a></li>
  <li><a href="#asking">Asking the Community</a></li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="searching"></a>Searching Existing Resources</h3>
<p>An easy step is to search the existing documentation. You just might find the answer you're looking for. </p>
<p>Use the Search box at the top of the main window in the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;to search all content across the platform. Specify multiple keywords to narrow your search.</p>

<h3><a name="writing"></a>Writing a Ticket</h3>
<p>If you're fairly sure the problem is a bug, write a ticket. If you're not sure if it's a bug, or you just have a question, you can still write a ticket to get help, but you could also just post a message. Other users might well be able to answer your question.</p>

<h3><a name="asking"></a>Asking the Community</h3>
<p>Many others in the user community are using the same methods that you are, often in very similar scenarios. If you ask, there's a good chance that another user will share some valuable insight that will help you.</p>

<h3><a name="paying"></a>Paying It Forward</h3>
<p>If you run into a problem, it's possible if not likely that someone else might have the same trouble as you, now or in the future. If you have a workaround, coding recommendations, or any other information that might be useful to others, consider taking a few extra minutes to comment or to start a discussion. Sharing what you've learned adds to the value of the platform for everyone.</p>
