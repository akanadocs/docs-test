If encoding was used to transfer the message safely, this value indicates the encoding method used. Example: <strong>chunked</strong>. For HTTP 1.1 messages, the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Akana API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API always uses the value <strong>chunked</strong>. For HTTP 1.0, transfer-encoding is not used.<br /><strong>Note</strong>: We recommend using HTTP version 1.1 since it includes several enhancements; chunking is one of them.
