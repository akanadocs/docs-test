Deprecated. Registers the user, so that the user can log in and perform authenticated actions. As of version 8.4, this operation is replaced by <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="../users/m_users_completeSignUpAdvanced.htm">POST&nbsp;/api/users/completeSignup</a></span> (extended functionality, different headers). The pre-existing operation is supported for backwards compatibility, but it's best to use the new operation instead.
