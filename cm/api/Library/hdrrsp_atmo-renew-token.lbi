<strong>renew</strong>. This is a custom response header used when the action of the method causes a change in a value  that's stored in the token. The token includes information on the user's apps, APIs, and groups, so actions such as adding an app or accepting an invitation to join an app team require update of the token. A value of <strong>renew</strong> means that the operation has changed some information that's stored in the token, and you must therefore renew the token using the <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="../login/m_login_renewToken.htm">POST&nbsp;/api/login/renewToken</a></span> operation.
