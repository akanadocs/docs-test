<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">When an HTTP GET operation in the platform returns information in the form of an RSS channel, it very often includes entity references. Where an RSS item represents an object, the entity references include additional information about the object. For example, if the RSS channel returns information about an app version, the entity reference might include information about the app to which the app version belongs. All relevant relationships to the object returned in the RSS response are represented in the entity references.
