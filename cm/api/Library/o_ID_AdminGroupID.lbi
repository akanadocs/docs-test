The unique ID for the Admin Group associated with a specific resource, such as an API or business, comprised of all administrators associated with that resource. Only used in response messages. <!--Example usage: &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;getAPIAdministrators&lt;/span&gt; returns a list of administrators. Alternatively you can use the groupID and invoke the group API, getMembers operation. Or if you want to add an administrator you can get the groupID and invoke the inviteMemberToGroup operation.In the group API you would use it as the group ID. We return the team ID of the app and use it to manage the app team members using the group API. AdminGroupID is always applicable to an API group.-->
