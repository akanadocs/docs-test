Used in both request and response to specify whether the message can be cached between the client and the server.&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Akana API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;operations generally do not cache responses, so the value is generally <strong>no-cache</strong>. In some instances, such as with avatars and content, it is more efficient to cache the information. In these cases, we set a value in the Cache-Control response header. For example: <strong>Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800</strong>. This sets the content to be cached for 604800 seconds (one week).
