<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">Indicates whether the metric information that's returned should be broken up by time interval. For example, if the TimeInterval value is five minutes (5m) and the Duration value is one hour (1h), and ShowIntervalData is set to true, the results would include 12 sets of information, one for each five-minute interval. Time interval data can be used to create a bar chart.
