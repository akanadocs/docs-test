<a name="how_do_i_collaborate_in_the_platform"></a><h3>How do I collaborate in the platform?</h3>
<p>The platform includes an <em>API Board </em>and <em>App Board</em> that can be used to promote APIs and Apps, manage issues associated with the development cycle, or enhance the visibility of topics relating to a specific app or API.</p>
<p id="api_app_talkbox"><strong>App/API Board</strong></p>
<p>Each app and API has its own <em>Board</em> that includes both a topic board and a ticket management system.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>App Developers / team members with access privileges to apps or APIs can collaborate by posting a discussion topic, or can raise issues for a specific app or API creating a ticket.</li>
<li>Comments can be posted to board items or tickets. In addition, system-generated tickets are posted for activities that require a line of approval; for example, an API access request or a team member invitation.</li>
<li>You can filter Board activity for a specific app or API to help find what you want. For example, you can filter so that only a specific Board item is displayed (for example, tickets) or you can specify search criteria such as keywords.</li>
<li>Board entries associated with discussions and tickets are posted as notifications to the <em>Dashboard</em> of participating users. You are also sent email notifications for certain events, and you can turn email notifications on or off (see <a href="basics_account_management.htm#how_do_i_enable_or_disable_email_notifications">How do I enable or disable email notifications</a>) but you always get the Board notifications.</li>
<li>Boards for both API and App resources have similar functionality, a set of sort controls that are common to both resources, and custom sort controls that are unique to the ticketing and post functions.</li>
</ul>

<a name="what_are_the_differences_between_the_app_and_api_boards"></a><h3>What are the differences between the App and API Boards?</h3>
<p>At the app level (<em>My Apps &gt; App Board</em>), collaboration is made possible by inviting individuals to join your application development team. Team members can then create private discussions with other team members pertaining to an app and the APIs it is consuming, and can create tickets pertaining to issues associated with app development.</p>
<p>At the API level (<em>My Apps &gt; Board</em>), API developers and app team members can post discussions pertaining to a specific API, or create tickets pertaining to issues associated with API operation.</p>
<p>For more information about the App Board, see <a href="app_collaborate_app_board.htm">App Board</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the API Board, see <a href="app_collaborate_api_board.htm">API Board</a>.</p>

<a name="where_can_i_find_review_information_for_each_api"></a>
<h3>Where can I find rating and review information for each API?</h3>
<p>Each API can include rating and review information from platform community members. The information is available on the <em>API Details</em> page as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Peer Rating</strong>&#8212;This section uses a star rating system to record positive feedback. A rating counter displays feedback for each rating number (1-5 stars, with 5 being the highest rating), and displays an average rating.</li>
  <li><strong>Peer Review</strong>&#8212;This section provides a list of written reviews submitted by the platform community for the current API. You can browse the reviews and filter information by Most Recent, Most Popular, Current or All versions, or enter a Search tag. You can also give the review a thumbs up in the &quot;Was this review helpful?&quot; section.</li>
</ul>
