<a name="what_is_the_purpose_of_an_api_legal_agreement"></a><h3>What is the purpose of an API legal agreement?</h3>
<p>When you request access to an API, you might be required to accept a legal agreement such as an end-user license agreement, developer agreement, or service legal agreement. Legal agreements typically pertain to API usage requirements, limitations, liability, and service level expectations. The API provider is responsible for providing and enforcing the legal agreement.</p>
