<a name="does_the_platformprovide_api_documentation"></a><h3>Does the platform provide API documentation?</h3>
<p>Each API includes a set of reference documentation which is available via the <em>My APIs &gt; API Name &gt; Documents </em>tab. The specifics in terms of what documentation is offered vary from API to API.</p>
<p>In some cases, certain APIs, or portions of them, have restricted visibility. In those cases, you would need to be invited to have visibility into those properties and their associated documentation. However, in many cases, the API documentation is publicly shared. You can locate it by using the Search feature in the platform.</p>
<p>A typical API documentation set might include the following sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Overview</strong>&#8212;A summary of the API functionality, links to reference documentation for the operations, and a Getting Started section that illustrates key information and steps for using the API.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Guide</strong>&#8212;Reference documentation for each API operation (method). A typical organization might include use cases, URI (endpoint), sample request, request parameters, sample response, response parameters, and error handling information.</li>
  <li><strong>Users Guide</strong>&#8212;Instructions for how to connect to the API, and ideally a walkthrough of API use cases.</li>
</ul>
