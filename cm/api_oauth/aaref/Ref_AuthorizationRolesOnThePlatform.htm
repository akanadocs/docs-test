<h2 id="top">Authorization Roles on the Platform</h2>
<p>Some operations can be performed even if a user is not logged in to the platform, such as viewing certain types of content. Other operations, such as adding an app, require login.</p>
<p>In other cases, activities are further restricted so that certain operations can only be performed by a member of a certain user group or group. For details about these scenarios, see <a href="#access_private">Access to Private Resources and Content</a> below.</p>
<p>Certain roles, such as the business administrator, have a senior level of access to multiple resources.</p>
<p>The authorization roles used by the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Akana OAuth<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API are listed and explained below. If an API call doesn't meet the necessary authorization role criteria it fails. If a user doesn't have the required access to a private resource, the operation runs successfully, returning an HTTP code 200, but information relating to the private resource is not returned. Depending on the scenario, the response might include a subset of information or might not contain any information at all.</p>
<p>The documentation for each operation includes information on the authorization roles that are required to run the operation.</p>
<p>Authorization role specification is prefaced by <strong>AuthorizationRole</strong>; for example, <strong>AuthorizationRole.USER</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="access_private">Access to Private Resources and Content</h3>
<p>Some operations can be performed even if a user is not logged in to the platform, such as viewing certain types of content. However, when resources are marked as Private, a user doesn't see those resources even if an operation doesn't require login. For any resources or content with additional access restrictions applied to it, a user must meet additional requirements before seeing the resource or content. The operation will still run successfully, but the private results will not be returned.</p>
<h5>Private API Access</h5>
<p>If an API version is private, it can be seen only by a user who has one of the following roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>API Administrator</li>
  <li>Business Administrator</li>
  <li>Sie Administrator</li>
  
  <li>Invited users (includes API Context Group members and members of additional groups invited by the Private API Administrator)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Private App Access</h5>
<p>If an app version is private, it can be seen only by a user who has one of the following roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>App team member</li>
  <li>Business Administrator</li>
  <li>Sie Administrator</li>
</ul>

<h5>Private Group Access</h5>
<p>To view information relating to a group that's designated as Private, a user must have one of the following roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Group Administrator (for an API Context Group, the API Administrator)</li>
  <li>Group member</li>
  <li>Group leader</li>
  <li>Site Administrator</li>
  <li>Business Administrator</li>
</ul>
