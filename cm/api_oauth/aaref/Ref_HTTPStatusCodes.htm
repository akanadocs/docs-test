<h2 id="top">HTTP Status Codes</h2>
<p>HTTP status codes break down into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>100-199: Informational messages</li>
  <li>200-200: The message was successful</li>
  <li>300-399: Redirection</li>
  <li>400-415: Error on the client side</li>
  <li>500-599: Error on the server side</li>
</ul>
<p>Recognizing the general numeric category could be helpful in tracking down the source of an error.</p>
<p>The table below provides information on some of the more common HTTP error codes you might encounter when working with the&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Akana OAuth<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API. For a full list of HTTP error code numbers and meanings, refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html" target="_blank">the HTTP spec</a>.</p>
