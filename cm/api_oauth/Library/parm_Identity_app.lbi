<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">When adding an app version, you can specify a custom identity name for the app version. If no custom value is specified, in response messages this property defaults to the reverse of the RuntimeID, with a dash. For example, if the RuntimeID is <strong>123456.acmepaymentscorp</strong>, the value for the Identity property would be <strong>open-123456</strong>.
