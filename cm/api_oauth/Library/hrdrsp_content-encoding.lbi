Indicates the type of compression encoding the server used for the response message, so that the client can decode the message. This is the counterpart to the <strong>Accept-Encoding</strong> request header which specifies which types of compression are acceptable in the response. Example: <strong>gzip</strong>. The&nbsp;<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp;API always returns a gzip-encoded response if the request header indicates that gzip encoding is accepted for responses.
