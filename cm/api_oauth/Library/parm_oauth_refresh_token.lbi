<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">The Refresh Token. Refresh tokens may be issued to the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires. A refresh token is a string representing the authorization granted to the client by the resource owner. The string is usually opaque to the client. The token denotes an identifier used to retrieve the authorization information. Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are intended for use only with authorization servers and are never sent to resource servers.
