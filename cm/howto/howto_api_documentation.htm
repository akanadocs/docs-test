<h1 id="top">Documentation Visibility Overview</h1>
<p>The three &quot;how-to&quot; documents below describe how to use licenses to control the visibility of documentation files and content. You can learn how to set up a simple scenario where you have a set of documents for an API with an overview doc, and one document for each API operation. The documentation for some of the API operations should only be visible to users with an admin license, while the rest should be visible to all users. All of the docs also contain a content element for example, a footer) with links to each of the other docs.</p>
<p>The additional documents provide reference information about managing document visibility, and a use case with instructions and video.</p>
