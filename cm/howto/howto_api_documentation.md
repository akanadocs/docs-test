## Howto Setup Documentation Visibility
These article describe how to use licenses to control the visibility of documentation files and content in both the default and developer themes.  

They describe how you can setup a simple scenario where you have a set of documents for an API with an overview doc, and one document for each API operation.  The documentation for some of the API operations should only be visible to users with an admin license, while the rest should be visible to all users.  All of the docs also contain a content element (e.g. a footer) with links to each of the other docs.
