<h2 id="add_app">How do I add an app?</h2>
<p>If you're logged in to the Community Manager developer portal, in most cases you can add an app from top menu bar: <strong>APIs</strong> &gt; <strong>Add API</strong>. See below. </p>
<p>In some cases, the <strong>APIs</strong> menu might not include this option. If the option isn't available to you and you need to add an app, contact the Site Admin.</p>
<p>You might also want to add an app in the context of a specific business organization on the platform. See <a href="bus_admin_organizations.htm#business_apps_manage">How do I manage apps for my organization?</a></p>


<h4>To add an app</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Add App</strong>. The <strong>Add App</strong> page displays.</li>
	<li>Specify values for your app. The minimum values required are app name and description, version ID and version notes. Use the field descriptions below to help you make your choices:
		<table class="doctable">
			<thead>
				<tr>
				<th>Name</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
					<tr>
							<td>App Name</td>
							<td>A descriptive name for your app. When developing an app naming convention, note that your initial app name will be automatically assigned as the App Name for subsequent versions (for example, Version 1.0) and will be <strong>{App Name} {App Version Name}</strong>.</td>
				</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Summary</td>
						<td><p>A brief, plain-text description of your app (optional). Text entered in this field is displayed in the list view.</p>
							<p><strong>Note</strong>: The values you provide for <strong>Summary</strong> and <strong>App Description</strong> are used to construct search results. For more information, see <a href="#app_search_results">How can I control the search results entry for my app?</a> below.</p></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>App Description</td>
						<td><p>A detailed description of your app. It's a good idea to include marketing, functional, and use case information.</p>
						<p><strong>Note</strong>: The values you provide for <strong>Summary</strong> and <strong>App Description</strong> are used to construct search results. For more information, see <a href="#app_search_results">How can I control the search results entry for my app?</a> below.</p></td>
					</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Version ID</td>
				<td>The app version name; for example, <strong>v1</strong>, <strong>Version 1.3</strong>.</td>
			</tr>

			</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>App ID (on some systems)</td>
				<td><p>A custom app identity for the current app definition. If left blank, the app will be randomly assigned an App ID (identity) in the format {fedmember} - {random-hex}.</p>
					<p>Notes:</p>
					<ul>
	<li>The AppID is not case-sensitive. If you're specifying the AppID, make sure you choose a unique set of character (numbers/letters). For example, if you have <strong>appid12345-acmepaymentscorp</strong>, you cannot add <strong>APPID12345-acmepaymentscorp</strong>.</li>
	<li>Once assigned, the App ID cannot be changed. </li>
</ul></td>
			</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Shared Secret (on some systems)</td>
				<td>A custom Shared Secret for the current app definition. If left blank, a shared secret is automatically generated. To view it, on the app's <strong>Details</strong> page, click <strong>Show Keys</strong> &gt; <strong>Click to View</strong>. Depending on platform settings, the shared secret might be encrypted when displayed. A Shared Secret can be regenerated for a specific app using the <strong>Regenerate Key</strong> function on the app's <strong>Details</strong> page.</td>

</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The app information is saved and posted to the app's <strong>Details</strong> page.</li>
</ol>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: In some cases, if an extension is in place, additional fields might appear in the bottom section of the <strong>Add App</strong> page. If so, these additional fields collect information about your app. Fields might be required or optional and might be of various types such as text-based or numeric, multiple selection, or dates. If you have questions about any of these fields, check the in-page tooltip (question mark to the right of the field) for help.</p>

<h2 id="how_do_i_decide_which_security_mechanism_to_use">How do I decide which security mechanism to use?</h2>
<p>The security mechanism you choose for the messages your app will send to one or more APIs determines the level of security applied to the message. In general, a stronger security mechanism might include more setup or more processing on the part of your app. Your choices will be determined by such factors as the nature of your app and the nature of the messages your app will exchange with the API. For example, an app that processes financial transactions might require greater security than one that returns movie information.</p>
<p>In addition, the requirements or limitations of the specific API or APIs you are using are a key factor.</p>
<p>The platform supports the following security mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
	<li>HMAC Signature with Shared Secret</li>
	<li>Hash/Digest with Shared Secret</li>
	<li>RSA Signature with PKI</li>
	<li>OAuth 1.0a</li>
	<li>OAuth 2.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the platform supports all of the above, a specific API hosted on the platform might not support them all. Check the API documentation for specific information about the security mechanisms supported.</p>
<p>For more information about the first three options, refer to <a href="app_security.htm">App Security Options and Setup</a>. For more information about OAuth options, refer to <a href="app_create_app_security.htm">App Security</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_does_an_app_consume_apis">How does an app consume APIs?</h2>
<p>After you create an app, several tasks must be performed so the app can consume an API.</p>
<table class="doctable">
<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Task</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>Identify APIs</td>
		<td>First, you must identify APIs you would like to add to your app. This can be done by performing a search via the <strong>Search</strong> menu and browsing the APIs on the <strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Details</strong> page of each API.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Provision App with Authentication Key</td>
		<td>Next, you must provision the app with an authentication mechanism. When you create your app, an App ID and Shared Secret are automatically assigned. If you prefer to use PKI over Shared Secret to sign your app, you can generate an X.509 Certificate file (CER), or a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and import it. See <a href="app_create_app_security.htm#how_do_app_credentials_work">How do app credentials work?</a></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Add APIs and gain access to Sandbox implementation</td>
		<td><p>After determining which API you want to access, the next step is to submit an API Access Request to license an API and gain access to the Sandbox or Live implementation.</p>
<p>
This task is performed using the <strong>API Access Wizard</strong> accessible by clicking the <strong>Access</strong> link on the <strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Details</strong> page of a selected API. Here you select the APIs which you would like to license. For APIs that require license agreement acceptance, you must review and agree to the terms of one or more license agreements before access will be granted. The <strong>Policies</strong> section allows you to select one or more SLA policies to be used for monitoring API performance and quota management.</p>
<p>Access to Sandbox or Live implementations is, in most cases, automatically approved. The Sandbox or Live endpoints are available and visible in the <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; choose app &gt; <strong>APIs</strong> page.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Build App</td>
		<td>The next step is to build your app as per the API requirements in terms of the semantics and security requirements of the API. Refer to the API documentation in the <strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Documentation</strong> section of your API for more information.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Configure the app's OAuth profile settings</td>
		<td><p>If your app will be using OAuth, specify preferences and configure the branding settings for the Grant Authorization page that your users will see, on the App Details &gt; OAuth Profile page.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Complete App Testing in Your Sandbox</td>
		<td>Set up simulated user accounts and data in your sandbox and test your app.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Request Live Approval</td>
		<td>When you are finished testing and ready to gain access to the API's Live implementation, request access using the API Access Wizard. Upon approval, you will be ready to make calls to the Live endpoints.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Update Application with Live Endpoint</td>
		<td>When the status of the Live Endpoint is &quot;Activated&quot; you must then update your app with the Live implementation URL.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td height="26">Activate</td>
		<td>After the Live implementation endpoint is updated in your app, you can select <strong>Activate</strong>.</td>
	</tr>

<h2 id="how_do_i_manage_app_visibility">How do I manage app visibility?</h2>
<p>When you create an app using <strong>Create a New App</strong>, you can control whether visibility of the app is <strong>Public</strong> or <strong>Private</strong> via the &quot;Visibility&quot; option. You can change app visibility based on your requirements using the <strong>Edit</strong> function on the app's <strong>Details</strong> page.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A public app is visible to all individuals that use the site, is searchable, and displays in the <strong>All Apps</strong> search filter.</li>
	<li>A private app is visible to the creator, in the <strong>My Apps</strong> search filter, and to individuals that are members of the app team.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_does_app_versioning_work">How does app versioning work?</h2>
<p>You might need to have more than one version of your app. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You might want to have one version for support and/or testing, and another version for your customers to use.</li>
	<li>You might want to have variations of your app that use different APIs.</li>
<li>You might want to separate usage monitoring, discussions, and ticket management by app version.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any member of the app team can create a new instance (version) of an existing app. You can have multiple app versions.</p>
<p><strong>Creating the first app version</strong></p>
<p>When you create an app, your app definition becomes the first version.</p>
<p><strong>Adding another app version</strong></p>
<p>After creating your app and first version, you can create an additional version. Go to <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; choose app &gt; Details. On the left, click <strong>Add Version</strong>. Define values in the same way as you did for the original app.</p>
<p><strong>Viewing App Versions</strong></p>
<p>To choose a specific app version, select it on the <strong>Version</strong> menu: <strong>Details</strong> page, top right.</p>
<p><strong>Team Management</strong></p>
<p>App team members are team members for the entire app, including all versions. There is no separate team for an app version.</p>
<p><strong>App Management</strong></p>
<p>App versions can be managed using a variety of different tools available on the app's <strong>Details</strong> page.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="add_app_version">How do I add an app version?</h2>
<p>If you are on the team for a specific app, you can add a new version at any time.</p>

<h2 id="how_do_i_delete_an_app_version">How do I delete an app version?</h2>
<p>You can delete an app version on the app's <strong>Details</strong> page.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to delete an old version and add a new version, add the new version first. If you delete the only version, the app is deleted. If you add the new version, you can then delete the older version.</p>
<h4 id="pro_to_delete_an_app_version">To delete an app version</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; choose app &gt; <strong>Details</strong>.</li>
	<li>From the <strong>Version</strong> drop-down at the top right of the page, choose the version you want to delete.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Delete Version</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the confirmation message, click <strong>OK</strong>. The app version is deleted.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_do_i_delete_an_app">How do I delete an app?</h2>
<p>When there is only one version of an app, and you delete it, the entire app is deleted. If there is more than one version, and you want to delete the app, you must delete each version separately.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In some cases, the platform might be set up so that deleting an app requires Business Admin approval. If this is the case, and you attempt to delete the app, you will see a message that the deletion request has been sent for approval. The app is inactivated pending approval; at this point, only the Business Admin can make changes. When the Business Admin approves the request, the app is fully deleted. If for any reason the Business Admin denies the request, the app is restored to normal operation.</p>
<h4>To delete an app</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Follow the instructions in <a href="#pro_to_delete_an_app_version">To delete an app version</a> above.</li>
	<li>The confirmation message warns you that deleting the last version deletes the app. Click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm. The app is deleted.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_do_i_export_an_app">How do I export an app?</h2>
<p>You can export information about an app to an external file. You can then import that file to another instance of the platform. One use of this feature is to move data from one environment to another, such as from a development environment to a testing environment.</p>
<p>You can choose to export information about a single app version or all app versions. You can also choose whether or not to export additional data associated with the app.</p>
<h4>To export an app</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; choose app &gt; <strong>Details</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the Export dialog, choose export versions (current version or all versions) and choose export options. If you want to export all information about the app, check all boxes. You can choose to export the following additional data associated with the app:
		<ul>
	<li>Export App PKI</li>
	<li>Export API Contracts</li>
	<li>Export App Team Members
		<p><strong>Note</strong>: the relationship of the user as an app team member is exported, but the user is not exported. The user must exist in the target environment. If the user does not exist when the information is imported, the app is created without that team member. From there it can be fixed in several ways: a) the user can sign up and be invited to be an app team member, b) the user can sign up and the app data can be reimported, c) another individual can be designated as an app team member.</p></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose to save or open the export file. By default, the export package file is named <strong>application-export.zip</strong> and is saved to your default downloads folder.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>




<h2 id="what_are_the_contents_of_the_app_export_file">What are the contents of the app export file?</h2>
<p>The app export file includes all the core information about the app, as well as any of the optional additional information you specified.</p>
<p>The file has a very specific structure. It will generally include the following files at root level:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>objectgraph.xml</strong>: An XML file that shows the relationships between resources.</li>
	<li><strong>objectdata.xml</strong>: An XML-based summary of all the data in the export file.</li>
	<li><strong>exportproperties.properties</strong>: a properties file showing which options were included in the export file.</li>
</ul>
<p>If PKI information was chosen to be exported, it is stored in a separate pki subfolder.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_do_i_import_an_app_from_an_export_file">How do I import an app from an export file?</h2>
<p>Any member of the app team, or a Business Admin, can export information about an app to an external file. However, only a Business Admin can import.</p>
<p>If you need help with import functions, contact your Business Admin.</p>
<p>If you are a Business Admin, refer to <a href="bus_admin_export_import.htm#import_org_app_api">How do I import site, app, or API information from an export file?</a> for instructions.</p>

<h2 id="app_search_results">How can I control the search results entry for my app?</h2>
<h4 class="stamp">Valid in Version: 2019.1.32 and later</h4>
<p>When users are searching for your app, or performing any search that will include your app in the search results, a snippet of information is displayed about your app in the search results.</p>
<p>The search results entry is an opportunity to showcase your app in a brief summary.</p>
<p>In earlier versions, the Community Manager developer portal displayed the copy from the <strong>App Description</strong> field for the search results entry. In 2019.1.32 and later, it constructs the copy for the search results entry by pulling information (depending on the term or terms that the user searches on) from either or both of these two fields in the app definition:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Summary</li>
	<li>App Description</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of a search results entry is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/app_search_results.png" alt="Search results entry for an app" /></p>
<p>For information about setting up the <strong>Summary</strong> and <strong>App Description</strong> fields, see <a href="#add_app">How do I add an app?</a> above.</p>
<p>After you've defined values for these fields and saved your app, it's a good idea to check how your app will appear in search results. To do this, just go to <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>All Apps</strong> and search. If you want to adjust the snippet of information in the search results, modify the values for one or both of these fields, save, and then check again.</p>
