<a name="how_do_i_perform_the_oauth_setup_process_in_the_platform"></a><h3>How do I perform the OAuth setup process in the platform?</h3>
<p>The OAuth setup process involves a series of configuration tasks performed by different roles (i.e. Site Administrator, API Provider, and App Developer) to achieve the end result of being able to authorize your app using an OAuth Provider. This quick start provides an end-to-end walkthrough to illustrate the overall process and roles performing each task. The walkthrough includes links to more detailed topics within the help.</p>

<p>A Resource Owner domain is an identity store that defines OAuth Providers you would like to establish access permissions with. Selecting a Resource Owner is typically based on the most common method by which users will be accessing an API or application (Google&reg;, Yahoo&reg;, Facebook&reg;, etc.).</p>
<p><em>Note: Configuring one or more Resource Owner domains is a prerequisite to configuring an OAuth Provider domain. Configured Resource Owner domains automatically populate the OAuth Provider domain user interface and are required input when you configure the OAuth Provider domain.</em></p>

<h3>Prerequisite: Install Resource Owner and OAuth Provider Features</h3>
<p><em>Performed by: Site Administrator</em></p>
<p>Before you can configure authorization domains, you must install the Resource Owner and OAuth Provider domains via the <em>SOA Software Administration Console</em>. Site Administrators can refer to the <em>Community Manager Installation Guide</em> (available on the SOA Software Support Site) for complete installation instructions. See <a href="site_admin_domains.htm#what_domain_types_are_supported">What domain types are supported?</a> for a list of features and descriptions. <br />
 <br />
 <em>Note: This task is performed as part of the initial platform setup process.</em></p>



<h3>Step 1: Configure Resource Owner Domain</h3>
<p><em>Performed by: Site Administrator / API Provider</em></p>
<p>The first step in the OAuth Provider configuration process is to identity the target user base that will require authorization when logging into an application. For example, if your users typically use Google as a method of performing an external login, the Site Admin will need to set up a Google Connector domain. If your users typically use SiteMinder as a method of performing an external login, they will require an LDAP identity store.</p>
<p><strong>CA SiteMinder or LDAP</strong></p>
<p>Skip this step if you are you are using a Policy Manager CA SiteMinder or LDAP Identity System that you have integrated and configured to support Single Sign-On as the Identity System will already display on the &quot;Resource Owner Authentication Domain&quot; drop-down menu in the <em>Admin &gt; Add Domain &gt; OAuth Provider Wizard</em>.</p>
<h5>To configure an LDAP Resource Owner Domain:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>The LDAP Resource Owner Domain is preinstalled and is available for selection when you configure the OAuth Provider domain. Continue to Step 2.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Step 2: Configure OAuth Provider Domain</h3>
<p><em>Performed by: Site Administrator / API Provider</em></p>
<p>After configuring your Resource Owner Domain, the second step is to configure an OAuth Provider domain.</p>
<h5>To configure an OAuth Provider domain:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Follow the steps in <a href="site_admin_domains.htm#how_do_i_set_up_and_configure_an_oauth_provider_domain">How do I set up and configure an OAuth Provider domain?</a> and then continue with Step 3.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Step 3: Configure API with OAuth Provider</h3>
<p><em>Performed by: API Provider</em></p>
<p>After the Site Administrator / API Provider configures the Resource Owner and OAuth Provider domains, they are available on the <em>API &gt; Details</em> page via the <strong>OAuth Details</strong> function.</p>
<h5>To configure OAuth for your API:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Follow the steps in <a href="api_admin_oauth_support.htm#how_do_i_configure_my_api_with_an_oauth_provider">How do I configure my API with an OAuth Provider?</a> and then continue with Step 4.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Step 4: Configure OAuth Security Credentials for App</h3>
<p><em>Performed by: App Developer</em></p>
<h5>To configure your app with OAuth:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Perform <a href="app_create_app_security.htm#how_do_i_configure_oauth_credentials">How do I configure OAuth credentials?</a> and continue to Step 5.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Step 5: Test OAuth Configuration </h3>
<p><em>Performed by: App Developer</em></p>
<h5>To test authorizing your app with OAuth and send a request:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Perform <a href="app_test.htm#how_do_i_test_authorization_of_my_app_with_oauth_using_the_dev_console">How do I test authorization of my app with OAuth using the Dev Console?</a></li>
</ol>
