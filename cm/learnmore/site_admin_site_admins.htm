<p>The <em>Site Administration</em> quick filter launches the <em>Site Administration</em> section. Authorized site administrators can send out invitations to others whom they would like to invite to be site admins. All site admins have the same administration privileges for the platform deployment and can configure authentication domains that can be customized and assigned to APIs that are part of the platform deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Invite Administrators</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Invite More</strong> function allows you to send invitations to individuals that you would like grant administration privileges for your API.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Existing administrators  are displayed in a summary listing.</li>
  <li>When an invitation is sent a request email is issued.</li>
  <li>The invitee receives an invitation request on their <em>Dashboard</em> page. If the invitee is not a platform member, they must sign up using the same email address that the invitation is addressed to in order to accept the invitation via their <em>Dashboard</em>.</li>
  <li>While an invitation is still pending, a <strong>Resend Email</strong> button is available so you can remind the invitee.</li>
  <li>At any point after a member has been invited, a <strong>Remove</strong> button is available so that you can remove the invitee or team member.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>View Administrators</strong></p>
<p>When an administrator invitation is submitted, a new entry is added to the list with the username, email address, and an initial <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_invitationstatus">invitation status</a> of <strong>Pending</strong>.</p>
