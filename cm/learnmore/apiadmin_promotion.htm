<a name="promotion_overview"></a><h3>What is the promotion feature?</h3>
<p>The platform includes an add-on feature, Lifecycle Coordinator, which allows the Administrator to define a one-way topology that includes a chain of environments reflecting the development lifecycle. For example, the topology chain could be from <strong>Development</strong> to <strong>Testing</strong> to <strong>Staging</strong> to <strong>Production</strong>. Each environment is a separate installation of the developer portal.</p>
<p>Lifecycle Coordinator is a standalone user interface that's installed separately. The new feature also includes modifications to the developer portal user interface to allow the API Admin to promote an API to the next environment.</p>
<h5>Lifecycle Coordinator</h5>
<p>Within the Lifecycle Coordinator, the authorized user can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define and manage the environment topology (two or more environments in a unidirectional chain).</li>
<li>Set up processing rules that are executed when an API is promoted from one specific environment to the next. For example:
<ul>
<li>A rule might change the target URL host for the physical services when an API is promoted from Staging to Production.</li>
<li>A rule might deploy an API to different deployment zones in the Production environment depending on the PCI compatibility of the API.</li>
<li>A rule might define an approval required for the resource to be promoted to the next environment. If approval is required, the resource will be in a <strong>Promotion Pending</strong> state until the promotion is approved.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The new feature includes a new user permission for the user who manages the Lifecycle Coordinator.</p>
<h5>Developer Portal</h5>
<p>Within the developer portal user interface, the new feature allows the API Admin or Business Admin to promote an API from the current environment to the next step in the environment topology.</p>
<p>When the user in the developer portal promotes the API, the API is passed to the Lifecycle Coordinator. The next steps are governed by the process set up in the Lifecycle Coordinator. For example, if a manual approval is required, approval is requested. If processing rules are in place, the rules are applied to the data before it is promoted to the next environment. The status of the promotion request is reflected in the developer portal user interface; for example, <strong>Promoted</strong> or <strong>Promotion Pending</strong>.</p>


<a name="promotion_iterations"></a><h5>Iterations</h5>
<p>A resource can be promoted to the next lifecycle stage multiple times, each time being an iteration of the resource, to accommodate a development scenario where multiple changes are made before the API is fully mature and ready to move to the next stage.</p>
<p>For example, an API might be promoted from Development to Testing, and some errors found in Testing. It can then be updated in the Development environment and promoted to Testing again, possibly multiple times until it fully passes Testing and is ready to be promoted to the next lifecycle stage in the next environment.</p>
<p>In the Lifecycle Coordinator, each of these iterations is stored, for historical tracking and non-repudiation.</p>
<h5>Deployment</h5>
<p>In terms of deployment, the Lifecycle Coordinator can be co-located with any one of the tenants, or it can stand alone and communicate remotely with any of them.</p>

<a name="promotion_installed"></a><h3>How do I know if the promotion feature is available for my API?</h3>
<p>If the promotion feature is available for your API, you'll see extra sections in the developer portal, showing the current state of the API, as shown in the examples below.</p>

<h5>API Overview page</h5>
<p>You'll see an extra section to the right of your API <strong>Overview</strong> page, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/promotion_api_overview.jpg" alt="Promotion feature for an API; Overview page" /></p>
<p>The extra section shows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Current environment / status in current environment</li>
  <li>Environment chain / status in each environment</li>
  <li><strong>Promote</strong> button</li>
</ul>

<h5>API Designer</h5>
<p>You'll see additional information at the bottom of the API Designer page, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/promotion_api_designer.jpg" alt="Promotion feature for an API; API Designer page" /></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="api_promote"></a><h3>How do I promote my API?</h3>
<p>When your API is ready to be promoted, just click the <strong>Promote</strong> button, as shown above.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you promote the API, and then find you need to make further changes, you can just make the changes and then promote it again. You can promote your API from one environment to the next as many times as you need to. See <a href="#promotion_iterations">Iterations</a> above.</li>
  <li>What happens to the API after you click the <strong>Promote</strong> button is determined by the workflow in place in the Promotion Coordinator. For example, if approval is required, the resource isn't actually promoted until approval is granted.</li>
</ul>
