<h3 id="how_do_i_collaborate_in_the_platform">How do I collaborate in the platform?</h3>
<p>The platform includes the following forums that can be used to share information about apps and APIs and manage issues associated with the development cycle:</p>
<ul>
	<li>App forum</li>
	<li>API forum</li>
	<li>Group forum</li>
	<li>User forum</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>App, API, and Group Forum</strong></p>
<p>Each resource has its own Forum. The app and API forums include topics and a ticket management system (<strong>App</strong> &gt; <strong>Forum</strong> or <strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Forum</strong>). </p>
<p>For information on which forums include which types of forum entries, see <a href="basics_forums.htm#what_types_of_board_items_show_up_on_which_boards">What types of Forum items show up on which Forums?</a></p>
<p>You can filter Forum activity for a specific resource to help find what you want. For example, you can filter so that only a specific Forum item is displayed (for example, tickets) or you can specify search criteria such as keywords.</p>
 <p>Forum entries associated with discussions and tickets are posted as notifications to the <strong>Dashboard</strong> of participating users. You are also sent email notifications for certain events, and you can turn email notifications on or off (see <a href="basics_account_management.htm#email_notifications_manage">How do I enable or disable email notifications</a>), but you always get the Forum notifications.</p>
 <p>Forums for all types of resources have similar functionality; a set of sort controls that are common to all resources, and custom sort controls that are unique to the ticketing and post functions.</p>
 <p>For general information about working with forums, see <a href="basics_forums.htm">Forums</a>.</p>

<p><strong>User Forum</strong></p>
<p>Each user has a link, in the top navigation bar, to his/her personal forum. Each user's forum includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_forumentry">forum entries</a> for all apps the user has created or subscribed to.</li>
	<li> <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_forumentry">forum entries</a> for all APIs the user has created or subscribed to.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The user forum </p>
<p>Each app has its own <strong>Forum</strong> that includes topics and a ticket management system.</p>
 <ul>
	<li>App Developers / team members with access privileges to apps or APIs can collaborate by posting a discussion topic, or can raise issues for a specific app or API creating a ticket.</li>
<li>Comments can be posted to Forum items or tickets. In addition, system-generated tickets are posted for activities that require a line of approval; for example, an API access request or a team member invitation.</li>
<li>You can filter Forum activity for a specific app or API to help find what you want. For example, you can filter so that only a specific Forum item is displayed (for example, tickets) or you can specify search criteria such as keywords.</li>
<li>Forum entries associated with discussions and tickets are posted as notifications to the <strong>Dashboard</strong> of participating users. You are also sent email notifications for certain events, and you can turn email notifications on or off (see <a href="basics_account_management.htm#email_notifications_manage">How do I enable or disable email notifications</a>) but you always get the Forum notifications.</li>
<li>Forums for both API and App resources have similar functionality, a set of sort controls that are common to both resources, and custom sort controls that are unique to the ticketing and post functions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what_are_the_differences_between_the_app_and_api_boards">What are the differences between the App and API Forums?</h3>
<p>At the app level (<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_myapps_nav_all.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; choose app &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Forum</strong>), collaboration is made possible by inviting individuals to join your application development team. Team members can then create private discussions with other team members pertaining to an app and the APIs it is consuming, and can create tickets pertaining to issues associated with app development.</p>
<p>At the API level (<strong>My APIs</strong> &gt; <strong>App</strong> &gt; <strong>Forum</strong>), API developers and app team members can post discussions pertaining to a specific API, or create tickets pertaining to issues associated with API operation.</p>

You can browse the reviews and filter information by Most Recent, Most Popular, Current or All versions, or enter a Search tag. You can also give the review a thumbs up in the &quot;Was this review helpful?&quot; section.</li>
