<a name="what_is_an_api_access_legal_agreement"></a><h3>What is an API Access Legal Agreement, what does it include, and how is it used?</h3>
<p>The platform allows you to upload one or more <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_legalagreement_api">legal agreements</a> associated with your API. When a legal agreement is active for an API, an app developer must accept the legal agreement in order to request a contract with the API.</p>
<p>Some points to note about legal agreements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can upload multiple legal agreements.</li>
  <li>You can include such information as what is offered, service levels, limitations, and any other legal information you want to share with users of your API.</li>
  <li>You must activate a legal agreement before you can assign it to the API.</li>
  <li>If a legal agreement is associated with one or more active contracts, you cannot deactivate it.</li>
  <li>If the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_autoconnect">auto-connect</a> feature is enabled enabled in the version of the platform you are using, do not associate a legal agreement with the API, because there is no way for the user to accept the agreement in an auto-connect scenario. When auto-connect is enabled, this means that the API will be automatically connected with every new app that is created. If auto-connect in use in your environment, the only way to get end-users to accept legal terms associated with API usage is to get those terms included in the Developer Agreement that each user must accept when signing up for the platform.</li>
  <li>The platform supports the following file formats for legal agreements associated with an API: HTML (htm or html extension) or text (txt extension).</li>
  <li>Acceptance is required by only one app team member. Each app team member has equal rights and can make decisions on behalf of the team.</li>
  <li>If an app team member accepts a legal agreement and then leaves the team, the legal agreement is still considered to be accepted, since at the time the individual accepted the agreement he/she had authority to do so.</li>
  <li>If a contract is revised, and the legal agreement was already accepted for the contract by a member of the app team, the original legal agreement applies to the revised contract.</li>
</ul>

<a name="what_is_the_legal_agreement_maintenance_process"></a><h3>What is the legal agreement maintenance process?</h3>
<p>The legal agreement maintenance process includes the following steps.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1: Update and Upload Content: </strong>All legal agreement content must be developed and maintained outside the platform in your own HTML editor. Each time a content update is made, it must be uploaded to the site. See <a href="api_admin_content_guidelines.htm">Content Development Guidelines</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Activate / Deactivate Content:</strong> After you have published a legal agreement, it must be activated so it is available for selection in the <strong>Add a New API Wizard</strong>, and visible in the platform <strong>API Access Wizard</strong>. This is accomplished by clicking the <strong>Activate</strong> button in the <em>Status</em> section of the <em>Agreements Summary</em> screen, assigning a name and description to the legal agreement, and saving the configuration. Users that are not API Providers / Administrators cannot view a legal agreement in the API wizards, or in the <em>API &gt; Legal</em> section until it has been activated. You can restrict visibility of the legal agreement by clicking the <strong>Deactivate</strong> button (see <a href="#how_do_i_deactivate_a_legal_agreement">How do I deactivate a legal agreement?</a>). After the initial legal agreement activation, you can also edit the legal agreement name and description (see <a href="#how_do_i_edit_legal_agreement_details">How do I edit legal agreement details?</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3: (Optional): Report Statistics: </strong>If you would like to view statistics of legal agreement activation or deactivation activity, you can click the <strong>Report</strong> button and download a CSV file that includes the legal agreement name and username/date/time stamp of when the legal agreement was activated or deactivated.</li>
  <li>See <a href="api_admin_content_guidelines.htm">Content Development Guidelines</a> for more information on the legal agreement content development and maintenance.</li>
</ul>
