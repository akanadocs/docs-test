<h3 id="org_app_manage">How do I manage apps for my business organization on the platform?</h3>
<p>In the API platform, providing you have sufficient permissions, you can add and manage apps at the root level.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In Default Theme, click the <strong>Plus</strong> menu and choose <strong>Add a New App</strong>, or click the <strong>My Apps</strong> icon to view the apps list.</li>
	<li>In Hermosa Theme, click the <strong>Plus</strong> sign and choose <strong>Add App</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The platform also supports setting up a business organization. You can then add apps and APIs at the organization level. You have full rights to manage these apps, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#org_app_add">Adding an app</a></li>
	<li><a href="#org_app_view">Viewing apps</a></li>
	<li><a href="#org_app_modify">Modifying an app</a></li>
	<li><a href="#org_app_delete">Deleting an app</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To perform activities relating to apps and APIs at the organization level, you must first log in, and then choose the organization. You can then view and manage resources that were set up at the organization level.</p>

<h3 id="org_app_add">How do I add an app to an organization on the API platform?</h3>
<p>Adding an app to a specific organization on the platform is essentially the same as adding an app at the root level. However, when you first specify an organization and then add the app within the context of the organization, the app visibility is limited to those who have visibility of the organization.</p>
<p>Only a Business Admin of the organization can add, modify, or delete apps within the organization.</p>
<h5>To add an app to a business organization:</h5>

	<li>Find your organization on the list, and then click the title to view the <strong>Details</strong> page for the organization.</li>
	<li>In the left menu, click <strong>Apps</strong>. All apps associated with the organization are displayed.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add</strong>. The <strong>Add App</strong> page displays.</li>
	<li>Add an app in the same way as you would at the root organization level. For detailed instructions, see <a href="app_create_app_add.htm#add_app">How do I add an app?</a></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>You can move an app that's in the context of one of your businesses into another business, as long as you are a Business Admin for both organizations. For example, you might have a billing department and a payments department, and create the billing app in the context of the payments department by mistake. You can easily move it. Follow the steps below.</p>
