      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Unless APIs have their own vanity URLs, APIs on the platform will have the same hostname. Each API must have a unique endpoint, and the platform's validation that the context path is unique ensures that the API endpoint will be unique.

<h3 id="settings_config_app_oauth_profile">How do I configure App OAuth Profile Authorization settings?</h3>
<p>As part of app setup, app developers can specify which settings they want to use when connecting to an API using OAuth. These settings are configured from the App Details page: <strong>App Details</strong> &gt; <strong>OAuth Profile</strong>.</p>
<p>There are five groups of settings on this page. </p>
<p>The first four are controlled by the app developer, and are detailed in <a href="app_create_app_oauth_profile.htm#app_oauth_profile_settings">What are the settings available on the App OAuth Profile page?</a> (app developer help):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Branding Settings</li>
	<li>Access Token Settings</li>
	<li>Authentication Settings</li>
	<li>ID Token Settings</li>
	</ul>
<p>Settings in the last group are controlled by the Site Admin or specially authorized app developers only:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authorization Settings</li>
</ul>
<p>The last set, Authorization Settings, are normally not visible to the app developer. In most cases, these settings can only be configured by the Site Admin. However, the Site Admin can implement a custom workflow that allows app developers to modify these settings. If the custom workflow is in place, app developers will see the settings.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: These settings give the app developer significant responsibility. In most cases, app developers should not be able to configure these settings for their apps. Only implement the custom workflow that allows app developers to modify these settings if you are absolutely sure they fully understand the meaning of the various settings and will use them appropriately.</p>
<p>For information about the first four setting categories, available to all app developers, refer to <a href="app_create_app_oauth_profile.htm#app_oauth_profile_settings">What are the settings available on the App OAuth Profile page?</a> (app developer help).</p>

<h3 id="settings_config_challenges_about">About security challenge questions</h3>
<p>Security challenge questions allow users to set up answers to questions, that only they will know, to act as a backup layer for authentication purposes.</p>
<p>Normal authentication to the Akana API Platform is by username/password, unless two-factor authentication (2FA) is in place. However, security challenge questions/answers allow the user to set up information by which he/she can authenticate without a password in certain scenarios, such as if the user forgot the password.</p>
<p>Ideally, the answers to the questions should be pieces of information that are not easily findable in the public domain. For example, questions such as &quot;What is your mother's maiden name?&quot; or &quot;what is the name of your dog&quot; might be easy for a malicious hacker to find the answers to, on the internet or on social media. Questions that prompt for information less easily discoverable, such as the person's favorite childhood vacation spot or their childhood best friend's dog, are more secure.</p>
<p>When you're setting up security challenge questions, bear in mind usability as well as security. If you make the questions too difficult, users might forget their own answers, or might write down the answers. If you make them too easy, a hacker could find out the answer from the internet or social media. It's a balance.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In the developer portal, the security challenge feature doesn't allow users to give the same answer twice. This is a precaution against users being lazy and using a default value, which is less secure, rather than setting up authentic answers to the questions.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Adding constraints to security challenge questions, such as minimum number of letters, numbers, or uppercase characters, increases the security of the question/answer security challenge scenario. However, don't forget usability. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the question asks for pet's name, the answer is not likely to contain numbers. If the question asks for city of birth, the answer should allow spaces since many city names have more than one word. Make sure that the questions and the constraints work together sensibly.</li>
	<li>Some last names include special characters such as an apostrophe, so setting a constraint that doesn't allow special characters in a last name field might stop the user from setting the true value, thus making it more difficult later on for the user to retrieve account access using the challenge questions/answers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The number of questions you set up on this page does not control the number of security questions presented to the user. It only affects the selection. The number of security questions required is in <strong>Business Security Settings</strong>; <strong>Challenge Count</strong>. See <a href="#settings_config_security_business">How do I configure settings for business security?</a> below.</p>

<h3 id="settings_config_challenges">How do I configure settings for security challenge questions?</h3>
<p>The platform comes with defaults for security challenge questions. However, you can add new questions and you can delete existing questions.</p>
<p>You can change the constraints for an existing question, such as how many characters are required or allowed, but you can't change the question itself.</p>
<p>When you delete a security challenge question, it remains in the database but is no longer available for selection by users. However, if a user has already set up an answer to a question that is later deleted, and the user then needs to use the question (for example, if the user forgot his/her password), the question and answer are still available for use.</p>

<h5 id="proc_challenge_question_add">To add a security challenge question:</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Log in as the Site Admin and <a href="site_admin_overview.htm#admin_menu_siteadmin">go to the Admin section</a>.</li>
	<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Challenges</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add Security Question</strong>.</li>
	<li>On the <strong>Add Security Question</strong> page, specify the question code, the question, and any constraints you want to put in place for the answer.  For information on the fields, see <a href="#fv_security_challenge_qns">Security Challenge Questions: Settings</a> below.    </li>
	<li>When done, click <strong>Save</strong>. The question is immediately added to the list, and is available for users to choose from.</li>

<h5 id="proc_challenge_question_remove">To delete (inactivate) a security challenge question:</h5>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When you delete a security challenge question, it is no longer available for users to select from the list of questions and to set up an answer for. However, if any users have already chosen this question and set up an answer, they will still be able to use this question. For example, let's say User A chooses question A and provides an answer, and then you remove question A from the list. If User A chooses Forgot Password or any other activity that requires answering a security challenge question, the same question will be presented, and the user's answer can be validated against the stored answer.</p>

<h3 id="settings_config_security_business">How do I configure settings for business security?</h3>
<p>You can configure settings to control the level of security associated with platform elements, and to control certain elements relating to security that affect platform users.</p>
<p>You can use the default out-of-the-box user workflow in combination with user settings and business security settings relating to users, to control user experience on the platform and if needed to restrict what users can do. If you need more flexibility, you can design your own custom workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When you change a setting, it might take up to five minutes for the change to take effect.</p>

<h3 id="settings_config_captcha">How do I configure CAPTCHA on the platform?</h3>
<p>The developer portal's security features include the capability for the Site Admin to enable <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_captcha">CAPTCHA</a> challenge/response tests on certain pages. Using a CAPTCHA helps ensure that the entity performing the action is a human, not a bot.</p>
<p>The feature supports Google reCAPTCHA, reCAPTCHA v2, for validation of users by means of the "I'm not a robot" check box.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This feature does not support invisible reCAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA Android.</p>
<p>If you enable CAPTCHA support in the security settings, users will have to answer CAPTCHA challenges on these pages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sign Up</li>
	<li>Forgot Password</li>
</ul>
<p>Before enabling the feature, you must set up a Google reCAPTCHA account. Set up the correct domain for your developer portal in the reCAPTCHA account, without protocol (for example, acmepaymentscorp.com), and get the values for the Site Key and the Secret.</p>
<p>Once the Google reCAPTCHA account is set up with the domain value for the developer portal (for example, acmepaymentscorp.com), and the developer portal setting is enabled and set up with the CAPTCHA values, users signing up or clicking <strong>Forgot Password</strong> will be presented with a CAPTCHA challenge which they must pass as part of entering information on those pages. </p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The CAPTCHA Secret Key is never displayed anywhere in the developer portal user interface. In addition, the developer portal API doesn't return the secret key. It's encrypted and stored securely in the database.</p>

<h3 id="settings_prevent_ref_extsite">How do I prevent referencing external sites in developer portal content pages?</h3>
<p>It's possible to reference an external website within an &lt;iframe&gt; tag in a developer portal content page, using the <strong>&amp;doc</strong> parameter:</p>
<pre>{protocol}://{hostname}/{tenant}/#!{sitepage}&amp;doc={URL-encoded external URL}</pre>
<p>The example below illustrates how this might look using the Simple Developer theme's documentation page, and referencing the external website <strong>http://www.example.com</strong>:</p>
<pre>http://acmepaymentscorp.com/acmepaymentscorp/#!documentation&amp;doc=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com</pre>
<p>However, this feature could be an insecurity, since the external site to be displayed could potentially be modified via a malicious content injection. For Site Admins who want to disable the ability to reference external sites on a developer portal content page, there is a security setting, <strong>Allow display of external content in developer portal content pages</strong>. See <a href="#settings_config_security_business">How do I configure settings for business security?</a> above.</p>
