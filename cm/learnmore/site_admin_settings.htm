<a name="how_do_i_configure_settings_for_app_oauth_profile"></a>
<h3>How do I configure App OAuth Profile settings?</h3>
<p>As part of app setup, app developers can specify which settings they want to use when connecting to an API using OAuth. These settings are configured from the App Details page: <strong>App Details</strong> &gt; <strong>OAuth Profile</strong>.</p>
<p>There are five sets of settings on this page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Branding Settings</li>
  <li>Access Token Settings</li>
  <li>Authentication Settings</li>
  <li>ID Token Settings</li>
  <li>Authorization Settings (Site Admin or specially authorized app developers only)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last set, Authorization Settings, are normally not visible to the app developer. In most cases, these settings can only be configured by the Site Admin. However, the Site Admin can implement a custom workflow that allows app developers to modify these settings. If the custom workflow is in place, app developers will see the settings.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: These settings give the app developer significant responsibility. In most cases, app developers should not be able to configure these settings for their apps. Only implement the custom workflow that allows app developers to modify these settings if you are absolutely sure they fully understand the meaning of the various settings and will use them appropriately.</p>
<p>For information about the first four setting categories, available to all app developers, refer to <a href="app_create_app_oauth_profile.htm#settings_app_oauth_profile">What are the settings available on the App OAuth Profile page?</a> (app developer help).</p>
<p>Information about the additional Authorization settings, normally available only to a Site Admin, is given in the table below.</p>
