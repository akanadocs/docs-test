			<p><strong>Note</strong>: Unless APIs have their own vanity URLs, APIs on the platform will have the same hostname.

If you are sure that each API that is/will be hosted on your Community Manager developer portal will have a unique context path, you can disable this setting. Otherwise, leave it enabled (the default). If your Community Manager developer portal includes more than one API with the same endpoint, results will not be as expected.</p></td>

<h2 id="settings_config_app_oauth_profile">How do I configure App OAuth Profile Authorization settings?</h2>
<p>As part of app setup, app developers can specify which settings they want to use when connecting to an API using OAuth. These settings are configured from the App Details page: <strong>App Details</strong> &gt; <strong>OAuth Profile</strong>.</p>
<p>There are five groups of settings on this page. </p>
<p>The first four are controlled by the app developer, and are detailed in <a href="app_create_app_oauth_profile.htm#app_oauth_profile_settings">What are the settings available on the App OAuth Profile page?</a> (app developer help):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Branding Settings</li>
	<li>Access Token Settings</li>
	<li>Authentication Settings</li>
	<li>ID Token Settings</li>
	</ul>
<p>Settings in the last group are controlled by the Site Admin or specially authorized app developers only:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Authorization Settings</li>
</ul>
<p>The last set, Authorization Settings, are normally not visible to the app developer. In most cases, these settings can only be configured by the Site Admin. However, the Site Admin can implement a custom workflow that allows app developers to modify these settings. If the custom workflow is in place, app developers will see the settings.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: These settings give the app developer significant responsibility. In most cases, app developers should not be able to configure these settings for their apps. Only implement the custom workflow that allows app developers to modify these settings if you are absolutely sure they fully understand the meaning of the various settings and will use them appropriately.</p>
<p>For information about the first four setting categories, available to all app developers, refer to <a href="app_create_app_oauth_profile.htm#app_oauth_profile_settings">What are the settings available on the App OAuth Profile page?</a> (app developer help).</p>
<p>Information about the additional Authorization settings, normally available only to a Site Admin, is given in the table below.</p>

			<p>Options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>No explicit setting</strong>: The SameSite attribute is not set in the cookie (default behavior for backward compatibility). With this setting, the behavior depends on the browser default. In older browser versions, the default value is None; in newer browser versions the default value is Lax.</li>
				<li><strong>Lax</strong>: The cookie is not sent for a normal cross-site request (for example, to load images or frames into a third-party site), but is sent when a user is navigating to the origin site, such as when following a link.

<h2 id="settings_config_captcha">How do I configure CAPTCHA on the platform?</h2>
<p>The Community Manager developer portal's security features include the capability for the Site Admin to enable <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_captcha">CAPTCHA</a> challenge/response tests on certain pages. Using a CAPTCHA helps ensure that the entity performing the action is a human, not a bot.</p>
<p>The feature supports Google reCAPTCHA, reCAPTCHA v2, for validation of users by means of the "I'm not a robot" check box.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This feature does not support invisible reCAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA Android.</p>
<p>If you enable CAPTCHA support in the security settings, users will have to answer CAPTCHA challenges on these pages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sign Up</li>
	<li>Forgot Password</li>
</ul>
<p>Before enabling the feature, you must set up a Google reCAPTCHA account. Set up the correct domain for your Community Manager developer portal in the reCAPTCHA account, without protocol (for example, acmepaymentscorp.com), and get the values for the Site Key and the Secret.</p>
<p>Once the Google reCAPTCHA account is set up with the domain value for the Community Manager developer portal (for example, acmepaymentscorp.com), and the Community Manager developer portal setting is enabled and set up with the CAPTCHA values, users signing up or clicking <strong>Forgot Password</strong> will be presented with a CAPTCHA challenge which they must pass as part of entering information on those pages. </p>

		<p><strong>Note</strong>: The CAPTCHA Secret Key is never displayed anywhere in the Community Manager developer portal user interface. In addition, the Community Manager developer portal API doesn't return the secret key. It's encrypted and stored securely in the database.</p>

<h2 id="settings_prevent_ref_extsite">How do I prevent referencing external sites in Community Manager developer portal content pages?</h2>
<p>It's possible to reference an external website within an &lt;iframe&gt; tag in a Community Manager developer portal content page, using the <strong>&amp;doc</strong> parameter:</p>
<pre>{protocol}://{hostname}/{tenant}/#!{sitepage}&amp;doc={URL-encoded external URL}</pre>
<p>The example below illustrates how this might look using the Simple Developer theme's documentation page, and referencing the external website <strong>http://www.example.com</strong>:</p>
<pre>http://acmepaymentscorp.com/acmepaymentscorp/#!documentation&amp;doc=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com</pre>
<p>However, this feature could be an insecurity, since the external site to be displayed could potentially be modified via a malicious content injection. For Site Admins who want to disable the ability to reference external sites in a Community Manager developer portal content page, there is a security setting, <strong>Allow display of external content in developer portal content pages</strong>. See <a href="#settings_config_security_business">How do I configure settings for business security?</a> above.</p>
