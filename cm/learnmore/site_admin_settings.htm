<p>You can configure settings to control the level of security associated with platform elements, and to control certain elements relating to security that affect platform users.</p>
<p>You can use the default out-of-the-box user workflow in combination with user settings and business security settings relating to users, to control user experience on the platform and if needed to restrict what users can do. If you need more flexibility, you can design your own custom workflow.</p>
