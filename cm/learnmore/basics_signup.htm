<p>There is no need to sign up for an account to  view our API documentation and discussion boards. You can even view trouble tickets posted by  members of our community. However, you  must sign up an account to access our APIs for development and  production purposes. With an account, you can establish a project, invite others to collaborate with you, test your  application using our Dev Console, and receive permission to commercially publish an  app integrated with our APIs.</p>
