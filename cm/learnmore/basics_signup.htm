<h2 id="do_i_need_an_account">Do I need an account?</h2>
<p>There is no need to sign up for an account to view public APIs. There is also much public content such as discussion boards. You can even view trouble tickets posted by members of our community. However, you must create an account on the platform in order to access APIs. With an account, you can establish a project, invite others to collaborate with you, test your app using the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_testclient">Test Client tool</a>, and receive permission to commercially publish an app integrated with platform APIs.</p>

<h2 id="signup_account_new">How do I sign up for a new account?</h2>
<p>In many cases, all you need to provide is name, email address, and password. In some cases, additional information is required, depending on platform configuration.</p>
<p>Additional login domains might be available; for example, you might be able to sign up using Facebook or Google. See <a href="#signup_social_media">How do I sign up using a social media account?</a></p>

<h4>To sign up for a new account</h4>
<ol>
	<li>At the top of the Community Manager developer portal home page, click <strong>Log In</strong>, and then click <strong>Create Account</strong>.</li>
	<li>On the <strong>Sign Up</strong> page, provide your user information:
		<ul>
			<li>First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, and Confirm Password are required fields.
			<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: The portal creates your Profile Name from your First Name and Last Name. For example, if your first name is Adam and your last name is Smith, the default Profile Name is AdamSmith. After you create your account and sign in, the Profile Name is displayed at the top right of the page. If needed, you can change it later: see <a href="basics_account_management.htm#user_profile_edit">How do I edit my user profile?</a></p></li>
			<li>Your password must be different from your Profile Name (First Name / Last Name), and it must contain 8 to 20 characters, can contain alphanumeric characters, must include at least one letter and number, may include the following characters (%,&amp;, _, ?, #, =, -), cannot contain spaces, and is not case sensitive. To ensure account integrity, it's best to use a strong password, with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>
			<li>Depending on platform settings, you might also need to provide a full telephone number, with country code.</li>
			<li>Depending on platform settings, you might need to provide answers to one or more security challenge questions.</li>
			<li>Depending on platform settings, you might need to accept a platform legal agreement (Terms and Conditions). Click the link to review the agreement, and then click the check box to accept.</li>
		</ul>

<h2 id="signup_social_media">How do I sign up using a social media account?</h2>

<h4>To sign up using a social media account</h4>
<ol>
	<li>In the top navigation, click <strong>Log In</strong>. The login page is displayed.</li>
	<li>In the section below the <strong>Forgot your password?</strong> link, click one of the available social media icons (for example, Facebook or Google).

	<li>At the sign in page for your social media provider, log in using your credentials for the account (generally username/password or email/password). The example below shows logging in to a Google account.

		<p><img src="assets/login_google_done.jpg" alt="Logging in with Google" /></p></li>
</ol>
<p>You're now ready to get started on the platform. For example, you can:</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="account_privileges">What are my account privileges?</h2>
<p>If you signed up for an account you have privileges to create an application and utilize the full spectrum of development, application management, and collaboration features.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For the application projects you develop, you also are the sole administrator for the project.</li>
	<li>As an administrator, you can invite developers who are account holders to join your application team.</li>
	<li>Team members also have administrator rights for the app.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="account_log_in">How do I log in?</h2>
<p>The top navigation includes a <strong>Log in</strong> link.</p>

<h4>To log in using your credentials</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Click the <strong>Log in</strong> link at the top right.</li>
	<li>On the login page, specify your Email and Password, and click <strong>Log In</strong>.
	<p>When login is complete, you are taken to your <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_actiondashboard">Action Dashboard</a> page.</p>
	<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: In some cases, the Community Manager developer portal might be customized to take you to a different page. In addition, from certain pages, such as a specific app or API page, if you log in from that page you are redirected back to the same page after login, for your convenience.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>To log in using your third-party provider ID</h4>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: once you set up a platform account with an email that's authenticated via a third-party provider such as Facebook or Google, you cannot create a platform account using that email address, and you can only reset your password via the same third-party provider.</p>
<ol>

	<li>In the section below the <strong>Forgot your password?</strong> link, click one of the available social media icons (for example, Facebook or Google).</li>

</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="account_log_in_sa_invite">The Site Admin invited me. How do I log in?</h2>
<p>In some cases, a Site Admin might add you as a Community Manager developer portal user rather than asking you to sign up yourself.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the Site Admin will add basic information about you; generally, your first name, last name, and email address.</p>
<p>The Site Admin might specify a custom password, or the password might be generated by the platform.</p>
<p>The Site Admin will give you the information you need to log in to the portal for the first time, including the URL and the password. Usually, when you log in for the first time, you'll be required to change the password. You can also review the basic profile information added by the Site Admin, and adjust it if needed; see <a href="basics_account_management.htm#user_profile_edit">How do I edit my user profile?</a></p>
<p>It's important to log in to complete the account registration process. Your account isn't activated until you log in successfully for the first time. Until this time, you won't be able to perform certain basic user functions such as getting a password reset link if you forget your password.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="account_log_in_new_terms">How do I log in if the platform Terms and Conditions change?</h2>
<p>If the platform Terms and Conditions you reviewed and agreed to when you initially signed up to the platform change between logins, you will be required to review and agree to the new copy when you log in.</p>

<h4>To log in using your credentials</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Click the <strong>Log in</strong> link at the top right to go to the <strong>Login</strong> page.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Login</strong> area, specify your Email and Password, and click <strong>Login</strong>.</li>
	<li>If the Terms and Conditions have changed, you'll see a <strong>Pending Signup Agreement</strong> popup. Use the vertical scroll bar to navigate through the Signup Agreement and review the text. An example is shown below.
	<p><img src="assets/pending_signup_agreement.png" alt="Pending Signup Agreement"/></p>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Accept</strong> to accept the Terms and Conditions.
		<p>When login is complete, you are taken to your <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_actiondashboard">Action Dashboard</a> page.</p>
		<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: In some cases, the Community Manager developer portal might be customized to take you to a different page. In addition, from certain pages, such as a specific app or API page, if you log in from that page you are redirected back to the same page after login, for your convenience.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>To log in using your social media provider ID</h4>

</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_does_the_verification_code_work">How does the login verification code work?</h2>
<p>Some versions of the platform include an extra layer of login security. If that is the case, you'll be sent a special verification code by phone or email. The details depend on how the platform version you're using is set up; but basically you'll need to log in, providing your credentials in the usual way, and then provide the code.</p>
<p>Generally the code has quite a short life; for example, five minutes. If you don't manage to log in before the code expires, you can request a new one.</p>
<p>This extra layer of security helps protect you and your account, as well as the platform, from unauthorized users.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the verification code, or the process, contact your Site Admin.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="account_login_timeout">Why does my login time out?</h2>
<p>For security reasons, the Community Manager developer portal might be set to time out. There are two timeout settings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Timeout after a period of inactivity.</li>
	<li>Timeout even if a user is still active but has been using the portal for an extended period of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of session time that's allowed before the timeout occurs is controlled by the Site Admin.</p>
<p>If your session is active and reaches the maximum session time, you'll see a notification message prompting you to save your work. Save any change immediately so that you don't lose any work. There is no restriction on logging in again; you'll be able to log back in immediately after the timeout, or when you see the message you can simply log out and log back in again immediately.</p>
