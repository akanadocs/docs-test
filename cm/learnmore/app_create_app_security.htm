<h3><a name="h_appsecurity_generalinfo"></a>App Security General Information:</h3>



<a name="how_do_app_credentials_work"></a><h3>How do app credentials work?</h3>
<p>When your app sends messages to an API, your app's credentials identify it as the sender of the message. Very few APIs accept anonymous messages; in general, you'll need to set identify your app with every message.</p>
<p>As part of setting up your app, you must set up your app security on the App Details page, following these high-level steps (more details provided below):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select App Protocol / Determine Credential Approach.</li>
  <li>Configure Security Credentials.</li>
  <li>Set Values in App Details &gt; Security.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Select App Protocol / Determine Credential Approach:</strong></h4>
<p>There are several choices available to you in terms of security configuration for your app. You'll need to make sure you choose a security mechanism that's acceptable for the API or APIs you want your app to use.</p>
<p>The choices are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plain text App ID</li>
  <li>HMAC Signature with Shared Secret</li>
  <li>Hash/Digest with Shared Secret</li>
  <li>RSA Signature with PKI</li>
  <li>OAuth 1.0a</li>
  <li>OAuth 2.0</li>
</ul>
<p>For more detailed information about application security options, refer to <a href="app_security.htm">App Security Options and Setup</a>.</p>
<p>Each API is pre-configured as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each API is assigned either an &quot;API Consumer Application Security Policy&quot; or &quot;OAuthSecurity Policy&quot; that is defined in the Tenant.</li>
  <li>If the API supports OAuth, the API's OAuth Provider configuration is set to the OAuth version and grant types it supports.</li>
</ul>
<p>The credential approach configured in the app must match the protocol supported by the API as defined in these policies. Review the API documentation to verify the supported protocols.</p>
<pre><strong>Configure Security Credentials:</strong></pre>
<p>To authenticate your app when placing API calls, you must include your App ID and either a Shared Secret or your Public Key for PKI-based authentication (in the form of a CER or CSR).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Please note that each version of your app requires a separate set of security credentials.</li>
  <li>Also note that you will need to obtain access to an API and you must configure credentials correctly in order to make a successful call to the API sandbox or production endpoint.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Set Values in App Details &gt; Security:</strong></h4>
<p>The <em>Security</em> section of the <em>App Details</em> page includes the <strong>Show Keys</strong> function that displays the Shared Secret and Public Key options for generating or importing the credentials required to authenticate your app in the sandbox or production environments. When deciding on the type of security credentials you'll use for your app, it's a good idea to review the API documentation for APIs you'll want your app to use, to verify what the API supports and any requirements it might have.</p>
<p>When an app is initially created using the <strong>Add New App</strong> function, a shared secret is either provided, or is generated automatically. You can view the Shared Secret in the <em>App Details &gt; Security</em> section by clicking <strong>Show Keys</strong> and selecting <strong>Click to View</strong>. You can use the <strong>Regenerate Key</strong> option to issue a new shared secret.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Depending on the platform settings specified by your Administrator, the shared secret displayed on the App Details page might be encrypted. If the shared secret is encrypted and you need the actual value, you can decrypt it using the app's private key.</p>
<p> If you would like to use PKI-based encryption, you can use the <em>Public Key</em> option. The <strong>Import Credentials</strong> function allows you to upload a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with your public key embedded or an X.509 Certificate (CER).</p>
<ul>
  <li>After you have uploaded the CSR, the Certificate Authority associated with Tenant generates a certificate and associates the certificate with your app.</li>
  <li>If you uploaded an X.509 Certificate, it is verified against the Trusted CA Certificate store on the Tenant.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>OAuth 1.0a and 2.0:</strong></h4>
<p>If you are using OAuth 1.0a and the Authentication Code and Resource Owner Credentials grant, or OAuth 2.0 and the Authentication Code and Implicit grant, you must specify a Redirect URL and Application Type, then configure an authorization screen. This task is performed in addition to configuring security credentials and is optional based on your requirements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The show OAuth Details section on the <em>App Details</em> page is used if the OAuth Provider configuration of the API is set to OAuth 1.0a or OAuth 2.0 (with the grants stated above), and the &quot;OAuthSecurity Policy&quot; is selected in API configuration.</li>
  <li>To specify OAuth Details: In the <em>Security</em> section of the <em>App Details</em> page, click Show OAuth Details, and then click <strong>Edit</strong> to specify or modify OAuth Details. In the <strong>Edit OAuth Details</strong> overlay, specify the Redirect URL (the address of the authorization server) and the App Type (Public or Confidential). For more information about these settings, see <a href="#how_do_i_configure_an_oauth_resource_url_and_application_type">How do I configure an OAuth Resource URL and Application Type?</a></li>
  <li>Then use the <strong> Public Profile</strong> function to define a Resource Owner OAuth Authentication page. See <a href="#how_do_i_configure_a_resource_owner_oauth_authorization_page_for_my_app">. How do I configure a Resource Owner OAuth Authorization page for my app?</a> for detailed instructions.</li>
</ul>

<a name="what_are_the_options_in_the_security_section_of_the_app_details_page"></a><h3>What are the options in the Security section of the App Details page?</h3>
<p>Once you've created your app, you can manage app security via the Security section of the App Details page.</p>
<p>By default, only the App ID is displayed. Click the following links to view security-related information and perform security-related activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Show Keys</strong>&#8212;Provides access to multiple buttons, allowing you to complete the following activities relating to your app's security:
    <ul>
      <li>Regenerate Shared Secret. See <a href="#how_do_i_regenerate_a_shared_secret">How do I regenerate a shared secret?</a></li>
      <li>Click to view shared secret</li>
      <li>Modify Credentials: See <a href="#how_do_i_modify_my_app_credentials">How do I modify my app's credentials?</a></li>

      <li>Export Credentials: See <a href="#how_do_i_export_credentials">How do I export app credentials?</a></li>
      </ul>
  <p>When the buttons are visible, you can click Hide Keys to collapse the display again.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Show OAuth Details</strong>&#8212;Provides access to a display of the values you've set up already for OAuth, if any, and edit capability:
    <ul>
      <li>Redirect URL: (display only)</li>
      <li>Application Type (display only)</li>
      <li>Edit button allowing you to specify initial values or modify existing values.</li>

<a name="how_do_i_transfer_an_app_defined_on_another_system_to_the_platform"></a><h3>How do I transfer an app defined on another system to the platform?</h3>
<p>If you have an app that you have defined on another system that includes an App ID or Shared Secret you can transfer it to the platform based on the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>New App</strong> – If this is the first app version of your app, you can add it using the <strong>Add a New App</strong> function via the <em>Plus</em> menu and specify the App ID in the &quot;App Runtime ID&quot; field, and the Shared Secret in the &quot;App Runtime ID&quot; field. See <a href="app_create_app_creation.htm#how_do_i_create_a_new_app">How do I create a new app?</a> for more information.</li>
  <li><strong>App Version</strong> – If you would like to add an app defined on another system as a &quot;version&quot; of an app that is currently added to the platform, you can use the <strong>–Version</strong> function on the <em>App Details</em> page and specify the custom App ID in the &quot;App Runtime ID&quot; field, and custom Shared Secret (if applicable) in the &quot;App Runtime ID&quot; field. See <a href="app_create_app_versioning.htm#how_do_i_create_a_new_version_of_my_app">How do I create a new version of my app?</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

<div class = "divider1"></div>
<h3><a name="h_appsecurity_sharedsecret"></a>Shared Secret:</h3>






<a name="what_is_a_shared_secret"></a><h3>What is a Shared Secret?</h3>
<p>When you register your app, you have the option to specify an App Runtime ID and Shared Secret. If you do not specify values, they are generated for you.</p>
<p>These two values are used to identify your app when using the platform.</p>
<p> The Shared Secret is a binary hashed value known only to you and to the platform. In the <em>Security Credentials</em> section of the App Details page you'll see an option to view and manage your app's Shared Secret.</p>
<p>The Shared Secret approach follows the WS-Security digest authentication mechanism.</p>
<p>When generated by the platform for the app, the Shared Secret is a 40-character alphanumeric value. An example is shown below.</p>
<pre><a name="example_sharedsecret"></a>1008877afabf32efb31f9c974dbeaa688bed0769</pre>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_regenerate_a_shared_secret"></a><h3>How do I regenerate a shared secret?</h3>
<p>When you initially create an app using the <strong>Add a New App </strong>function, either you provide a value for the shared secret or it is automatically generated. If for any reason it becomes necessary, you can regenerate the shared secret later.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Depending on the platform settings specified by your Administrator, the shared secret displayed on the App Details page might be encrypted. If the shared secret is encrypted and you need the actual value, you can decrypt it using the app's private key.</p>
<h5>To regenerate a shared secret:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the <strong>App Details</strong> page for the app.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the <em>Security </em>section and click <strong>Show Keys</strong> to display the key generation options.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Shared Secret</em> section, click <strong>Regenerate Shared Secret.</strong></li>
  <li>Enter a comment regarding why you are regenerating the shared secret for the app. Share any relevant information.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Confirm</strong>. The shared secret is regenerated and the <em>Shared secret updated</em> message displays. Use <strong>Click to View</strong> to see the new shared secret key.
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Depending on the platform settings specified by your Administrator, the shared secret displayed on the App Details page might be encrypted. You can decrypt it using the app's private key.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_decrypt_an_encrypted_shared_secret"></a><h3>How do I decrypt an encrypted shared secret?</h3>
<p>If the version of the platform that you're using is set to display the shared secret as an encrypted value, you'll need to decrypt to get your app's actual shared secret value so you can use it when sending request messages to platform APIs.</p>
<p>If you uploaded a certificate/CSR for your app, the platform uses your app's public key to encrypt the plain text shared secret. You can then use your app's private key to decrypt and arrive at the plain text key.</p>
<p>It's important that you make sure you use the private key that corresponds to your app's public key that was uploaded to the platform. If the keys don't match, decryption will not give you the correct plain text value, or will fail completely.</p>
<p>If you have any doubt that the keys match, there are a couple of things you could do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Save the app private key and certificate together in a standard keystore format that supports both of them. Then, use the certificate serial number (or hash) with the hash/serial number that can be exported from the developer portal.</li>
  <li>Upload the certificate to make sure the platform has the latest public key, then display the value again and decrypt the new value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The approach you use to decrypting the encrypted shared secret value will depend on the tools and technologies you're using for your app. Basically you'll need to accomplish these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Copy the encrypted shared secret value from the App details page. If it's not visible, click Show Keys, and then click the <strong>Click to view</strong> button and copy the displayed value.</li>
  <li>Apply base64 decoding to take away the encoding cover and arrive at the encrypted bytes that are the shared secret.</li>
  <li>Make sure you are using the private key that corresponds to the certificate uploaded for the app.</li>
  <li>Use the appropriate cypher to decrypt a value encrypted using the RSA algorithm with PKCS1 padding. The decrypted bytes are an ASCII representation of the plain text shared secret.</li>
  <li>Retrieve the result and use it for your app's runtime.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is an example of an approach that would work if you have access to the Java runtime environment.</p>
<p>You can also use the command-line decryption tool. For more information, see <a href="#to_use_the_command_line_decryption_tool">To use the command-line decryption tool to decrypt the shared secret</a>.</p>

<a name="what_rules_apply_to_generating_an_appid_and_shared_secret"></a><h3>What rules apply to generating an App ID and Shared Secret?</h3>
<p>Before you add an app to the platform, review the following rules for generating an App ID or Shared Secret to determine the best approach for adding and managing your apps.</p>
<p><strong>App ID:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>When an app is created, you can specify a custom App ID. If the App ID field is left blank, the app is randomly assigned an App ID (i.e., identity) in the format &lt;fedmember&gt; - &lt;random-hex&gt;.</li>
  <li>Once an App ID is assigned it cannot be changed for the current app version.</li>
  <li>A new App ID can be assigned to a new app version using the <strong>+Version</strong> function on the <em>App Details</em> page and entering a new App ID in the &quot;App Runtime ID&quot; field.</li>
  <li>You cannot update an App ID using the <strong>Edit</strong> function on the <em>App Details</em> page. A new App ID can only be issued at the time the initial app is created using the <strong>Add a New App</strong> function, or when creating a new app version using the <strong>+Version</strong> function.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Shared Secret:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>When an app is created, you can specify a custom Shared Secret. If the Shared Secret field is left blank, a shared secret is automatically generated and can be viewed using the <strong>Show Keys</strong> function on the <em>App Details</em> page.</li>
  <li>Depending on the platform settings specified by your Administrator, the shared secret displayed on the App Details page might be encrypted. If the shared secret is encrypted and you need the actual value, you can decrypt it using the app's private key.</li>
  <li>to regenerate the  Shared Secret for a specific app using the <strong>Regenerate Key</strong> function on the <em>App Details</em> page.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="h_appsecurity_certificates"></a>App Credentials (Certificates/CSRs):</h3>






<a name="how_does_public_key_integration_work"></a><h3>How does public key integration work?</h3>
<p>If you use the <strong>Public Key</strong> option, you must import an existing X.509 Certificate (CER) or Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Usage of either public key option is based on your requirements. The Tenant can be configured with an internal Certificate Authority, and could also be configured with a set of Trusted CA Certificates apart from the internal Certificate Authority.</p>
<p>The following rules apply:</p>
<p><strong> Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<p>Based on the established public key strategy for your platform at least one of the following Public Key options must be established on the Tenant before you can successfully import a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) or X.509 Certificate (CER).</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Certificate Authority (CA) (internal or third-party) that can issue and renew X.509 certificates must be previously configured in the Tenant. See <a href="#what_is_a_certificate_signing_request">What is a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)?</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>Trusted CA Certificates that may be required must be uploaded to the <em>Trusted CA Certificates</em> section of the Tenant. See <a href="#what_is_a_trusted_ca_certificate">What is a Trusted CA Certificate?</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuring an internal Platform Certificate Authority is a post installation task that is performed by the Site Administrator. In most cases, a formal CA (for example, VeriSign) that aligns with the security policy requirements is uploaded, in addition to any Trusted CA Certificates that may be required.</p>
<p> If you receive an error message indicating that the X.509 Certificate or Certificate Signing Request (CSR) you are attempting to import is not trusted or that a Certificate Authority does not exist.</p>
<p><strong>Import Certificate Signing Request (CSR):</strong></p>
<ul>

<a name="what_is_a_certificate_signing_request"></a><h3>What is a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)?</h3>
<p>A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is a file that includes encoded information generated by a web server. It is sent from an applicant to Certificate Authority to request a digital certificate. The CSR contains information identifying the applicant and the public key chosen by the applicant. Before creating a CSR, the applicant first generates a key pair, keeping the private key secret. The corresponding private key is not included in the CSR, but is used to digitally sign the entire request.</p>
<p>A CSR file typically has a .CSR extension but can have other extensions based on the source application that generated the file. The Tenant supports the PEM (which is a BASE64 encoded PKCS10) for Certificate Signing Requests.</p>
<p>In the platform, a CSR is used to send a request to the Certificate Authority stored on the Tenant to request an X.509 Certificate.</p>
<p>The Tenant must be configured with a Certificate Authority prior to importing a CSR. This task is performed by the Site Administrator.</p>

<a name="what_is_a_trusted_ca_certificate"></a><h3>What is a Trusted CA Certificate?</h3>
<p>A Trusted Certificate Authority (CA) is a third party identity that is qualified with a specified level of trust. Trusted CA Certificates are used when an identity is being validated as the entity it claims to be. Certificates imported into Tenant must be issued by a Trusted CA Authority.</p>
<p>Trusted CA Certificates must be configured prior to importing X.509 certificates for platform apps. This task is performed by the Site Administrator.</p>

<a name="where_are_the_certificate_authorit_and_trusted_ca_certificate_files_stored"></a><h3>Where are the Certificate Authority and Trusted CA Certificate files stored?</h3>
<p>The platform Certificate Authority and Trusted CA Certificate files are stored on the Tenant. The Tenant is a distinct developer portal and community that is logical separated from any other communities that may be hosted in the same product instance. The Tenant is managed by the Site Administrator.</p>

<a name="what_are_the_oauth_20_client_types"></a><h3>What are the OAuth 2.0 Client Types?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Confidential Client</strong>&#8212;This client type is an application that is capable of keeping a client password confidential to the world. This client password is assigned to the client app by the authorization server. This password is used to identify the client to the authorization server, to avoid fraud. An example of a confidential client could be a web app, where no one but the administrator can get access to the server, and see the client password.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Client</strong>&#8212;This client type is an application that is not capable of keeping a client password confidential. For instance, a mobile phone application or a desktop application that has the client password embedded inside it. Such an application could get cracked, and this could reveal the password. The same is true for a JavaScript application running in the user's browser. The user could use a JavaScript debugger to look into the application, and see the client password.</li>
