<h3>How does the API visibility option work?</h3>
<p>The <em>API &gt; Visibility</em> menu option allows API Administrators to control who can see the API and its associated resources such as documentation and downloadable files. The API Admin can invite groups to have visibility of the API resources. The following group visibility scenarios are supported:</p>

</ul>
