<h2 id="action_dashboard_overview">What is the Action Dashboard?</h2>
<p>The Action Dashboard is a user-specific one-stop location for action items relating to activity on the Community Manager developer portal. It is an aggregate of information relating to all the boards that the user is following, including boards for apps, APIs, and groups.</p>
<p>When you log in to the platform, the first page that displays is your personal Action Dashboard page. If you're on another page, you can get to your Action Dashboard by clicking the link in the top navigation bar: <strong>Dashboard</strong> &gt; <strong>Action Dashboard</strong>.</p>
<p>An individual user's Action Dashboard includes information such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Changes to apps the user is associated with. When a user creates an app, the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_followrequest"><strong>follow</strong></a> relationship is created by default, but the user can still <strong>unfollow</strong> the app, in which case future items relating to that app are not posted to your Action Dashboard. Changes include:
		<ul>
			<li>New or deleted app versions.</li>
			<li>App contracts with an API: new, changed, or deleted contracts.</li>
			<li>App team changes: members added or removed.</li>
			<li>Notifications about tickets relating to the app.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Changes to APIs the user is following. Even if the user created the API, the <strong>follow</strong> relationship is not created by default, but the user can choose to follow the API. Forum items relating to APIs include:
		<ul>
			<li>New or deleted API versions.</li>
			<li>API contracts: new, changed, or deleted contracts.</li>
			<li>API Admin changes: API Admins added or removed.</li>
			<li>Notifications about tickets relating to the API.</li>
			<li>Alerts relating to the API.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Changes to groups the user is associated with:
		<ul>
			<li>Invitations to join a group, change in membership status, removal from a group.</li>
			<li>Changes in group membership: group members added or removed, change in membership status for another group member.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Items intended for that specific user (welcome message).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="can_i_control_which_items_appear_on_my_dashboard">Can I control which items appear on my Action Dashboard?</h2>
<p>There are a couple of ways you can help make sure you have relevant information on your Action Dashboard, without having so many messages that you miss important ones. You can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Edit your user settings to reduce the number of different types of notifications you receive. See <a href="basics_account_management.htm#proc_user_settings_edit">To edit user settings</a>. You can check or clear the boxes to receive notifications when:
		<ul>
		<li>Your apps receive alerts</li>
		<li>There are major changes to your app's lifecycle</li>
		<li>Posts are created for your apps</li>
		<li>There are changes to your app's team</li>
		<li>There are changes to your app's access to APIs</li>
		<li>Someone comments on your post</li>
		<li>There are changes to your API Scope Group</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can also choose to receive news updated by email.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Follow, or unfollow, resources depending on your level of interest. You can follow:
		<ul>
			<li>Apps: If you create an app, the follow relationship is created automatically. To unfollow, go to the App Details page and click <strong>Unfollow</strong>. You will no longer receive notifications relating to that app.</li>
			<li>APIs: With an API, the follow relationship isn't created automatically, but you can follow an API to receive notifications about it. Go to the API Details page and click <strong>Follow</strong>.</li>
			<li>Groups: If you create a group, the follow relationship is created automatically. To unfollow, go to the Group Details page and click <strong>Unfollow</strong>. You will no longer receive notifications relating to that group.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Customize the default view so that item types that you are more interested in are shown first. For example, if you are most interested in viewing Alerts, you can set up your preferences to use Alerts as the default filter.
	<p>For instructions, see <a href="basics_account_management.htm#profile_preferences">What user preferences can I set?</a></p></li>
	</ul>
