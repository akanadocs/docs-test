<a name="who_can_manage_user_accounts"></a><h3>Who can manage user accounts?</h3>
<p>Only Site Administrators can access the <em>Administration &gt; Users</em> page and manage user accounts.</p>
<p>Only a Site Administrator for Policy Manager can configure the user roles setting, which denies access to users with certain roles. For more information,  see <a href="#what_actions_can_i_perform_on_user_accounts">What actions can I perform on user accounts?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_manage_user_accounts_in_the_platform"></a><h3>How do I manage user accounts in the platform?</h3>
<p>There are two ways to manage platform access:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exclude specific roles from access</strong>: this is controlled by a setting in Policy Manager and requires installation of an add-on, <strong>SOA Software Scheduled Jobs</strong>. For more information, see <a href="#how_do_i_exclude_roles">How do I exclude specific roles from platform access?</a></li>
  <li><strong>Manage individual user accounts</strong>: the Site Admin can manage user accounts on the platform via <em>Administration&nbsp;&gt; Users</em>, on the List of Users page. This page provides a summary listing of user account details, statistics about each user's activity on the platform, and actions that a Site Admin can take on a user account. See <a href="#what_actions_can_i_perform_on_user_accounts">What actions can I perform on user accounts?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_actions_can_i_perform_on_user_accounts"></a><h3>What actions can I perform on user accounts?</h3>
<p>The Site Admin can perform the following actions on user accounts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a user: see <a href="#how_do_i_add_a_user">How do I add a user?</a></li>
  <li>Activate: see <a href="#how_do_i_activate_a_user_account">How do I activate a user account?</a></li>
  <li>Edit: see <a href="#how_do_i_edit_a_user_account">How do I edit a user account?</a></li>
  <li>Disable: see <a href="#how_do_i_disable_a_user_account">How do I disable a user account?</a></li>
  <li>Enable: see <a href="#how_do_i_enable_a_user_account">How do I enable a user account that's been disabled?</a></li>
  <li>Delete: see <a href="#how_do_i_delete_a_user_account">How do I delete a user account?</a></li>
  <li>Unlock a locked account: see <a href="#how_do_i_unlock_a_user_account">How do I unlock a user account?</a></li>
  <li>Lock: see <a href="#how_do_i_lock_a_user_account">How do I lock a user account?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Valid actions for a specific user account are determined by the account's current status, as shown in the table below.</p>
<table cellspacing="0px" class="doctable" style="width: 98%;">

<a name="what_are_the_components_of_the_list_of_users_page"></a>
<h3>What are the components of the List of Users page?</h3>
<p>The <em>Administration</em> section includes a <em>List of Users</em> page that allows you to manage site users. This page includes all users who have signed up to the platform, even if registration is not complete.</p>
<p>Some general points about this page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To sort by the information in a specific column, in ascending or descending order, click the column title once or twice.</li>
  <li><a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_search">Search</a> is available on the users list.</li>

<a name="how_do_i_add_a_user"></a><h3>How do I add a user?</h3>
<p>The Site Admin can add a new user to the platform by providing first name, last name, and email address. An email notification is sent to the user with login instructions, and a temporary password is generated and issued to the Site Admin.</p>
<p>The Site Admin must securely convey the password to the user.</p>
<p>To log in, the user must have the temporary password and must choose a new password. The user might also need to complete other steps such as accepting the platform legal agreement and providing answers to security challenge questions.</p>
<p>If you add a user, you can set up the user workflow so that when the user logs in for the first time a notification is sent to Site Admins and also to API Admins for any APIs the user is associated with (for example, if the user was automatically added to an app team via custom workflow, any APIs the app is associated with).</p>
<h5>To add a user:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Site Admin.</li>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Administration &gt; Users</em>.</li>
  <li>On the <em>List of Users</em> page, click <strong>Add User</strong>.</li>
  <li>On the Add User page, provide the following information:
    <ul>
      <li>First name</li>
      <li>Last name</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Password. You can specify a password, or leave the Password/Confirm Password fields empty and the platform auto-generates a password.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  
  <li>Specify whether the user will be forced to change the password when logging in for the first time. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  <li>At the notification message, <strong>copy the user's temporary password to a secure location</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
  <li>Convey the password securely to the user, who will also receive an email notification with login instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_activate_a_user_account"></a><h3>How do I activate a user account?</h3>
<p>When a new user signs up for the platform, the user account is automatically added to the platform and displays in the <em>Administration &gt; Users</em> section with a <em>pending_validation</em> status. The user registration process can be completed in two ways:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>By the user clicking the link in the notification email and completing the registration process.</li>
  <li>By the Site Admin activating the account (see below).</li>
</ul>
<h5>To activate a user account:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Site Admin.</li>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Administration &gt; Users</em>.</li>
  <li>On the <em>List of Users</em> page, find the user account you would like to activate.</li>
  <li>On the <em>Action</em> drop-down at the right, click <strong>Activate</strong>.</li>
  <li>At the notification message, click <strong>OK</strong>. The account status is immediately updated. Note that although the status change is immediate, there is a short delay before the information on the list is updated.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_unlock_a_user_account"></a><h3>How do I unlock a user account?</h3>
<p>Platform settings control whether a user gets locked out of an account if the wrong password is entered multiple times, and also control how long the user is locked out for.</p>
<p>The Site Admin can manually unlock a specific user account via the Users List. Follow the steps below.</p>
<h5>To unlock a user account:</h5>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_lock_a_user_account"></a><h3>How do I lock a user account?</h3>
<p>If needed, you can lock a user account. For example, you might need to do this if an account is compromised. The action takes effect immediately and the user will not be able to log in.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When an account is locked by the Site Admin, the account lock period defined in the platform settings does not apply; the account remains locked until the Site Admin unlocks it.</p>

<a name="how_do_i_protect_from_vulnerability_in_signup_and_forgot_password_scenarios"></a><h3>How can I protect from vulnerability in Signup and Forgot Password scenarios?</h3>
<p>If you're concerned with security, there is an extra step you can take to protect from a vulnerability in the Signup and Forgot Password scenarios that could allow a malicious user to enumerate user accounts.</p>
<p>There is a configuration setting that you can modify to restrict user enumeration in these scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Password reset</li>
  <li>New account setup</li>
</ul>
<p>The database field is ALLOW_USER_ENUM, in the BUSINESS_SECURITY_SETTINGS table. If enabled (set to <strong>com.soa.feature.enabled</strong>, or no value specified) the default behavior is in effect. If this value is set to <strong>com.soa.feature.disabled</strong>, the enhanced security behavior is activated.</p>
<p>You can modify this field in the user interface in the business security configuration settings: see <a href="site_admin_config.htm#how_do_i_configure_settings_for_security_business">How do I configure settings for business security?</a></p>
<p>The table below shows the default platform behavior and the enhanced security behavior for these two activities.</p>

<a name="what_are_the_user_roles_for_notifications"></a><h3>What are the user roles for notifications sent out from the platform?</h3>
<p>By default, the platform sends out email notifications to keep users informed about events of significance to a specific user; for example, membership changes to groups the user is a member of, or changes to an app or API the user is connected to.</p>
<p>Users can customize their preferences for email notifications: see <a href="basics_account_management.htm#how_do_i_enable_or_disable_email_notifications">How do I enable or disable email notifications?</a></p>
<p>In a scenario where the platform implementation includes more than one theme, the Site Admin can run a database script to customize the platform URL used for notifications to specific user roles: see <a href="site_admin_config.htm#how_do_i_configure_separate_notification_addresses_by_theme">How do I configure separate notification addresses for different platform themes?</a></p>
