<a name="what_is_a_custom_workflow"></a><h3>What is a custom workflow?</h3>
<p>There is a standard workflow for various types of resources on the platform. Some of these are controlled to some degree by options that can be specified in the user interface; for example, an API can be set up so that access requests to a specific environment are granted automatically or must be manually approved. However, other aspects of workflow cannot be modified by users via the user interface; for example, the roles required to modify a ticket.</p>
<p>In some cases, it's possible to replace the default workflow with a custom workflow, at the business level. The Business Admin can upload a customized workflow to the platform, and the Site Admin can modify the site configuration to change the workflow assigned to a specific type of object. For example, you could customize the Ticket workflow so that each new ticket automatically triggers an email to create a ticket in your own internal trouble ticketing system.</p>

<a name="which_workflows_can_i_customize"></a><h3>Which workflows can I customize?</h3>
<p>You can customize the following workflows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>API (Business Admin uploads in Administrator / Workflows; Site Admin specifies as default in Config / APIs) </li>
  <li>App (Business Admin uploads in Administrator / Workflows; Site Admin specifies as default in Config / Apps)</li>
  <li>API access request (Business Admin uploads in Administrator / Workflows; Site Admin specifies as default in Config / Connections)</li>
  <li>Group membership request (Business Admin uploads in Administrator / Workflows; Site Admin specifies as default in Config / Groups)</li>
  <li>Ticket (Business Admin uploads in Administrator / Workflows; Site Admin specifies as default in Config / Tickets) </li>
<!--  <li>OAuth Grants (must be changed in database; <a href="basics_support.htm#how_do_i_contact_technical_support">contact Technical Support</a>)</li>-->
</ul>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: OAuth grants cannot be customized at this time.</p>

<a name="how_do_i_set_up_and_manage_custom_workflows"></a><h3>How do I set up and manage custom workflows?</h3>
<p>There is a default workflow associated with various resources on the platform. For example, the default workflow for a ticket goes through the stages of the ticket being opened, modified, resolved, and closed.</p>
<p>The workflow definition guides the sequences of activities associated with resources. Workflow definition includes two important factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>State</strong>: the current state of the resource, which determines what actions can be taken. For example, a ticket can only be closed if it is currently open. </li>
  <li><strong>Role</strong>: certain actions are restricted to certain user roles. For example, only the individual who wrote a ticket, or the Administrator for the resource, can close a ticket.</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of these two factors, State and Role, guide the resource through its workflow.</p>
<p>In the platform, there is a default workflow for each resource. For a list of workflows that you can customize, see <a href="#which_workflows_can_i_customize">Which workflows can I customize?</a> above.</p>
<p>Once you've uploaded a custom workflow, you can specify that workflow as the default for the resource type. From that point onwards, the new workflow applies to any new resources of that type. Existing resources are not affected.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you customize the Ticket workflow so that each new ticket automatically triggers an email to create a ticket in your own internal trouble ticketing system. New tickets trigger this action; existing tickets are not affected.</p>
<h5><a name="to_upload_a_custom_workflow"></a>To upload a custom workflow:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Business Admin.</li>
  <li>Go to <em>Administration &gt; Workflows</em>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add Workflow</strong>.</li>
  <li>Enter the following values to describe the new workflow:
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Description</li>
      <li>Object Type&#8212;the type of resource the workflow applies to; <strong>APIs</strong>, <strong>Application</strong>, <strong>API Access Request</strong>, <strong>Group Membership</strong>, or <strong>Ticket</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  
  <li>Browse to the location of your custom workflow file and upload it.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've uploaded the custom workflow, the next step is for the Site Admin to assign the custom workflow to the correct resource type, following the instructions for the applicable object type:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="site_admin_workflows.htm#how_do_i_specify_a_custom_workflow_for_apps">How do I specify a custom workflow for apps?</a></li>
  <li><a href="site_admin_workflows.htm#how_do_i_specify_a_custom_workflow_for_apis">How do I specify a custom workflow for APIs?</a></li>
  <li><a href="site_admin_workflows.htm#how_do_i_specify_a_custom_workflow_for_api_contracts">How do I specify a custom workflow for API contracts?</a></li>
  <li><a href="site_admin_workflows.htm#how_do_i_specify_a_custom_workflow_for_groups">How do I specify a custom workflow for groups?</a></li>
  <li><a href="site_admin_workflows.htm#how_do_i_specify_a_custom_workflow_for_tickets">How do I specify a custom workflow for tickets?</a></li>
  <li><a href="site_admin_workflows.htm#how_do_i_specify_a_custom_workflow_for_users">How do I specify a custom workflow for platform users?</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: when the Site Admin specifies a new custom workflow for a resource, it affects all future resources. Existing resources are generally not affected. An exception is the users workflow; as part of installing a Community Manager upgrade, running the <strong>Upgrade CM Models</strong> task adds existing users to the new workflow. In some cases, it's possible to modify the workflow used for an individual resource. For example, the API Admin or Business Admin can modify the workflow that a specific API uses, in the API Details page.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_the_default_workflow_for_groups"></a><h3>What is the default workflow for groups?</h3>
<p>The default workflow for groups is shown below. This applies for all types of groups, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>App teams</li>
  <li>Independent Groups</li>
  <li>API Admins</li>
  <li>Private API Groups</li>
  <li>Site Admins</li>
  <li>Business Admins</li>
</ul>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: The workflow below shows the most complex group scenario, where the group has Admins, Leaders, and Members (Independent Group, Private API Group). For other types of groups, all members have Admin rights.</p>

<a name="how_do_i_specify_a_custom_workflow_for_users"></a><h3>How do I specify a custom workflow for platform users?</h3>
<p>You can use the default out-of-the-box user workflow in combination with user settings and business security settings relating to users, to control user experience on the platform and if needed to restrict what users can do. If you need more flexibility, you can design your own custom workflow.</p>
<p>The Site Admin can specify a custom workflow and set that as the default workflow for all future users on the platform. When the default workflow is changed, the new workflow applies to all new users. In addition, for A Community Manager upgrade scenario, running the Upgrade CM Models task adds existing users to the new workflow.</p>
<p>Before the Site Admin can specify the custom workflow as the platform default, the Business Admin or Site Admin must first create the custom workflow externally and upload it. For instructions, see <a href="business_admin_workflows.htm#to_upload_a_custom_workflow">To upload a custom workflow</a>. For information about custom workflows, see <a href="http://docs.soa.com/cm/assets/CM_WP_Workflow.pdf" target="_blank">
Community Manager: Custom Workflows</a> on docs.soa.com.</p>
<h5>To specify a custom workflow for platform users:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as Site Admin.</li>
  <li>Go to <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Users</em>.</li>
  <li>Under User Workflow Definition, click the drop-down list to choose the custom workflow. <span class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the workflow isn't available for selection, it hasn't yet been uploaded. For more information, see <a href="business_admin_workflows.htm#to_upload_a_custom_workflow">To upload a custom workflow</a>.</span> </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information on user settings, refer to <a href="site_admin_config.htm#how_do_i_configure_settings_for_users">How do I configure settings for users?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_the_default_workflow_for_platform_users"></a><h3>What is the default workflow for platform users?</h3>
<p>There is currently a default workflow that applies to all local platform users. Users who log in using a third-party identity provider are not managed by the default workflow.</p>
<p>The default workflow for platform users has a slightly different process depending on the type of user:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Self-signup user</li>
  <li>User invited by a Site Admin</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, the user profile can be modified as needed by the Site Admin.</p>
<p>If the platform settings allow users to modify their profiles, the user can also modify his/her own profile. This is evaluated in the workflow by means of the @ModifyProfile reserved action. If @ModifyProfile is present in the workflow and is applicable to the logged-in user, the user can modify his/her own profile.</p>
<p>The default user workflow checks the platform setting that governs whether users can modify their own profiles (Business Security settings, set up by the Site Admin; see <a href="site_admin_config.htm#how_do_i_configure_settings_for_security_business">How do I configure settings for business security?</a> in the Site Admin help).</p>
<p>The default workflow guides users through the login process, checking whether any or all of the following possible login conditions are currently required:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Must the password be changed? A user invited by a Site Admin logs in with a temporary password and must choose a new password as a first step.</li>
  <li>Is there a platform legal agreement in place that was not yet accepted by the user? If yes, the user must accept the legal agreement before proceeding with login.</li>
  <li>Must the user provide answers to security challenge questions? This could be the case on first login. There are also other circumstances that might trigger this; for example, the requirement to answer security challenge questions is added, or the number of answers each user must provide is increased.</li>
</ol>
<p>If one of these is required, the login process required that the user complete that one step. Login is then evaluated again. When all required conditions are met, the user is logged in. If it is the user's first login, the user is then marked as permanent in the database; this ensures that the user is not purged. Temporary user records, such as invitation codes that were issued and not responded to, are periodically purged from the database.</p>
<p>If you want to, you can create a custom workflow for users and set your custom workflow as the default. See <a href="#how_do_i_specify_a_custom_workflow_for_users">How do I specify a custom workflow for platform users?</a> above.</p>
