<a name="h_account_information"></a><h3>Account Information</h3>



<a name="how_do_i_set_up_a_user_account"></a><h3>How do I set up a user account?</h3>
<p>It's easy to set up a new account on the platform. From the homepage, click <strong>Log In / Sign Up</strong>.</p>
<p>The login page shows you what signup options you have. This might vary according to how the platform version you're using is configured:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Create Platform Account:</strong> In most cases, you can create a platform account. Click <strong>Create Account</strong> and then, at the Sign Up page, fill in the information requested. A signup email is sent to the email address you provide; you can then click the link in the email and complete the signup process.
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: In some cases, signup for new users might be disabled. If this is the case, you can only sign up at the invitation of a Site Admin.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Use Third-Party Authentication</strong>: In many cases, you might have one or more options to sign in by using a third-party identity provider such as Facebook, Google, or <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_casiteminder">CA SiteMinder</a>. If any of these options are available on your version of the platform, you will see buttons with applicable logos on the login page. Just click the button you choose and then authenticate with the third-party provider. You will need to complete your user profile by providing first and last name and accepting the platform Terms and Conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on setting up user accounts, see <a href="basics_support.htm">Sign Up</a>.</p>
<p>Once you've created your account and logged in, you can fine-tune your user profile. See below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_complete_user_account_setup"></a><h3>I received an email inviting me to join the platform. What do I do now?</h3>
<p>You might be invited to join the platform, and receive an email notification witih instructions. There are two main scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Someone who is already a platform member invites you to join the platform.</strong>
  <p>In this scenario, the invitation email will include a link with an invitation code. Click the link and then follow the instructions to complete signup. The invitation code is only valid for the email address the invitation was sent to.</p></li>
  <li><strong>The Site Admin adds you as a user.</strong>
  <p>In this scenario, the Site Admin will contact you with the password, which you will need to complete the registration process. When you have the password, click the link in the email and follow the instructions. Depending on the platform setup, you might need to choose a new password, accept a legal agreement, and/or provide answers to security challenge questions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've created your account and logged in, you can fine-tune your user profile. See below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>






<a name="what_are_the_security_questions"></a>
<h3>What are the security questions and how are they used?</h3>
<p>When you create an account on the platform, you might be asked to answer one or more <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_challengequestion">security questions</a>.</p>
<p>Answering the security questions provides an extra layer of protection for your account. Make sure you choose questions that you can easily answer, and would always answer in the same way. Later, if you perform certain operations such as changing or resetting your password, you will be prompted to answer one or more of these questions. Your answer is checked against the answer you originally provided, and must match.</p>
<p>Whether the security questions are in place, how many are required, and the exact questions used might vary according to the version of the platform that you're using.</p>
<p>Constraints on the answers might also vary; for example, some answers might require a maximum or minimum numbers of numbers, letters, or characters, and might not allow spaces or certain special characters. If there are constraints, you will see messaging to let you know what the guidelines are.</p>
<p>In all cases, if you're asked to answer one or more security questions when creating an account, your responses are stored securely and are used only to protect your account.</p>
<p>If by any chance you don't recall the answers to the security questions, and fail to correctly answer the security question, you will see a second security question, and then, if you fail again, a third question. After three unsuccessful tries, the account is locked for a period of time, generally 30 minutes. If needed, contact the Site Admin who can reset your password.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="why_doesnt_the_browser_remember_my_password"></a><h3>Why doesn't the browser remember my password?</h3>
<p>Many browsers allow the saving of passwords, and will sometimes offer a prompt asking if you want to save the password.</p>
<p>Although saving passwords is convenient, it's a potential security risk. For this reason, the platform has been modified so that even if the browser gives the save password prompt, the password is not actually saved. In addition, the auto-complete function is turned off on certain sensitive fields such as the email address at login. These changes have been made to enhance the security of our users.</p>
<p>We recommend that you never allow the browser to save your passwords.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_change_my_security_questions"></a><h3>How do I change my security questions?</h3>
<p>As part of signing up for the platform, you might be required to provide answers to one or more <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_challengequestion">security questions</a>. These are for the security of your account. For more information about security questions, see <a href="#what_are_the_security_questions">What are the security questions and how are they used?</a></p>
<p>You might want to change one or more of the security questions, or change your answer. Once you are logged in, you can do this at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The platform might be set up so that the answers to security questions are encrypted. If this is the case, you will see a message to that effect. Although your answers to the security questions are not shown except when you add them, your existing answers are stored. You don't need to do anything with questions and answers you don't want to change. Just provide new answers to any changed questions, or if you want to change your answer.</p>
<h5>To change your security questions and/or answers:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in to the platform.</li>
  <li>In the top navigation, click <strong>Profile</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the left navigation menu, click <strong>Security</strong>.</li>
  <li>Do either or both of the following:
    <ul>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="h_notifications"></a><h3>Notifications</h3>



<a name="how_do_notifications_work"></a><h3>How do notifications work?</h3>
<p>The platform offers two types of notifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dashboard notifications, displayed on your Dashboard in the platform user interface</li>
  <li>Email notifications, sent to you</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dashboard notifications</strong></p>

<p>When you log in, you are automatically taken to your Dashboard, where you might see one or more notifications to keep you informed of activity relating to your apps, APIs, and groups. In many cases you can take action directly from the Dashboard notification, such as accepting an invitation to a group.</p>
<p>In addition, after you've navigated to a different page, you can always view a summary of your notifications: in the top navigation bar, click the number indicator next to the <em>Dashboard</em> label. To see all notifications from this view, click the <strong>View All</strong> link at the bottom of the notifications indicator.</p>
<p>For more information about the Dashboard, see <a href="app_stay_informed.htm#what_information_is_displayed_on_my_dashboard">What information is displayed on my Dashboard?</a></p>
<p><strong>Email notifications</strong></p>
<p>Email notification messages are generated in response to certain events, such as changes relating to your apps, APIs, or groups.</p>
<p>For some events, such as password change, you will always receive an email notification. For other types of events, you can turn off the email notification option in your user settings. Even though the emails are not generated, you will still get Dashboard notifications for these events.</p>
<p>To turn off your email notifications: see <a href="#how_do_i_enable_or_disable_email_notifications">How do I enable or disable email notifications?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_enable_or_disable_email_notifications"></a>
<h3>How do I enable or disable email notifications?</h3>
<p>By default, the platform sends you email notifications when certain activities occur; for example, when a new member joins your app team or group. You can update your notifications settings on the <em>User Settings</em> page to turn email notifications off or on for certain events.</p>
<h5>To change your notification settings:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Access the <em>Settings</em> page (<em><a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_profile">Profile</a> &gt; Details</em>).</li>
  <li>If you want to change your setting for receiving news updates, check or clear the <strong>Email me news updates</strong> checkbox, if it is available.</li>
  <li>If you want to enable or disable email notifications, check or clear the applicable categories. Options include:
    <ul>
      <li>My Apps receive alerts</li>
      <li>There are major changes to my app's lifecycle</li>
      <li>Posts are created for my apps</li>
      <li>There are changes to my app's team</li>
      <li>There are changes to my app's access to APIs</li>
      <li>Someone comments on my post</li>
      <li>There are changes to my Private API Group</li>
      <li>Tickets referencing my apps are created or updated</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When you're satisfied with your settings, click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_respond_to_notifications"></a><h3>How do I respond to notifications?</h3>
<p>You can respond to notifications directly in the <em>Dashboard</em> or you can click the notification to display its Board entry and respond from there.</p>
