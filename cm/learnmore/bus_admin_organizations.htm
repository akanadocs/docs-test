<h2 id="what_is_an_organization">What is an organization?</h2>
<p>When you sign into the developer portal, the user interface you see, and the apps and APIs you can add, are at the root, or <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_tenant">tenant</a>, level.</p>
<p>You can also add a business organization, which is essentially a child organization to the root organization. </p>
<p>Each business organization can have its own apps and APIs, managed by one or more Business Admins.</p>
<p>As a Business Admin, you can also create child organizations. If needed, you can create a hierarchy of business organizations, each with its own apps and APIs.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="view_businesses_list">How do I see the Organizations List?</h2>
<p>In the Organizations List, the Business Admin can add, edit, view, or delete information about all the organizations for which you are a Business Admin on the developer portal.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A user who is not a Business Admin, but is a member of a specific organization, sees only the applicable organization on the Organizations List, and cannot add an organization.</p>
