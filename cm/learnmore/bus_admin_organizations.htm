<h3 id="what_is_an_organization">What is an organization?</h3>
<p>When you sign into the developer portal, the user interface you see, and the apps and APIs you can add, are at the root, or <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_tenant">tenant</a>, level.</p>
<p>You can also add a business organization, which is essentially a child organization to the root organization. </p>
<p>Each business organization can have its own apps and APIs, managed by one or more Business Admins.</p>
<p>As a Business Admin, you can also create child organizations. If needed, you can create a hierarchy of business organizations, each with its own apps and APIs.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h3 id="view_businesses_list">How do I see the Organizations List?</h3>
<p>In the Organizations List, the Business Admin can add, edit, view, or delete information about all the organizations for which you are a Business Admin on the developer portal.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A user who is not a Business Admin, but is a member of a specific organization, sees only the applicable organization on the Organizations List, and cannot add an organization.</p>
<h5 id="proc_businesses_list">To access the Organizations List</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Developer Portal.</li>
	<li>In the top navigation bar, follow the instructions appropriate for the version you're on, as shown below.

<h3 id="h_business_security">Business Security:</h3>




<h3 id="business_security_manage">How do I manage security for my organization?</h3>
<p>The API platform allows you to assign one or more specific roles to users.</p>
<p>All roles defined in the underlying Policy Manager infrastructure, either for the root organization or for the current business organization, are available to be assigned to users in your organization.</p>
<p>This accommodates many use cases and allows you to assign rights to create, view, modify, and delete resources in your organization, to a very fine level of granularity. You can control user access rights to a much more detailed level than the Developer, API Admin, Business Admin, and Site Admin roles supported in versions of the API platform prior to version 8.3.</p>
<p>You can assign access roles to specific users in your organization via the <strong>Security</strong> page. See <a href="#business_assign_roles_to_users">How do I assign security roles to users for my organization?</a> below.</p>
<p>You can also add roles. Currently, new roles must be added in Policy Manager, and are then available for selection in the API Platform UI. Roles added at the root organization level are available for all organizations; you can also add one or more roles for a specific organization, and they are available only for that organization.</p>
<p>For information on adding roles in Policy Manager, refer to the Policy Manager help.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h3 id="business_assign_roles_to_users">How do I assign security roles to users for my organization?</h3>

	<li>Find your organization on the list, and then click the title to view the <strong>Details</strong> page for the organization.</li>

		</ul>
		</li>
	<li>In the left pane, enter search criteria at the top, and then click <strong>Go</strong>, to locate users.</li>

<p>The summary below gives you the basic definition for each of the default roles. Note that your platform implementation might already include some customization of roles, in the underlying infrastructure. The definitions below are the defaults.</p>
<h5>Default roles:</h5>
<dl>
<dt>2FA-exempt users</dt>
<dd>A user who is exempt from platform 2FA verification. Even if two-factor authentication is required for platform users, it is not required for users with this role assigned.</dd>



<dt id="roles_apiadministrator">API Administrator</dt>
<dd>Responsible for managing APIs for the organization. The API Admin has full permission for operations relating to all APIs in the organization, including adding, modifying, and deleting APIs, API versions, and API implementations.</dd>
<dd>API Administrator and API Admin are the same role.</dd>
<dd><strong>Note</strong>: A user assigned the API Administrator role in the context of a business organization, who is not invited to a specific API, does not have permission to manage API Admins, such as adding or removing other API Admins. Only a user invited to a specific API has those permissions. For details, see <a href="apiadmin_overview.htm#apiadmin_management_capabilities">What API management capabilities are available to the API Admin in the platform?</a></dd>



<dt id="role_api_approver">API Approver</dt>
<dd>Responsible for approving APIs for publishing.</dd>



<dt>API Developer</dt>
<dd>API Developers have read-only access to the API.</dd>
