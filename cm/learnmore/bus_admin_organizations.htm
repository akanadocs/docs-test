<a name="what_is_an_organization"></a><h3>What is an organization?</h3>
<p>When you sign into the developer portal, the user interface you see, and the apps and APIs you can add, are at the root, or <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_tenant">tenant</a>, level.</p>
<p>You can also add a business organization, which is essentially a child organization to the root organization. </p>
<p>Each business organization can have its own apps and APIs, managed by one or more Business Admins.</p>
<p>As a Business Admin, you can also create child organizations. If needed, you can create a hierarchy of business organizations, each with its own apps and APIs.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="view_businesses_list"></a><h3>How do I see the Organizations List?</h3>
<p>In the Organizations List, you can add, edit, view, or delete information about all the organizations for which you are a Business Admin on the developer portal.</p>

<ol>

<a name="business_security_manage"></a><h3>How do I manage security for my organization?</h3>
<p>The API platform allows you to assign one or more specific roles to users.</p>
<p>All roles defined in the underlying Policy Manager infrastructure, either for the root organization or for the current business organization, are available to be assigned to users in your organization.</p>
<p>This accommodates many use cases and allows you to assign rights to create, view, modify, and delete resources in your organization, to a very fine level of granularity. You can control user access rights to a much more detailed level than the Developer, API Admin, Business Admin, and Site Admin roles supported in versions of the API platform prior to version 8.3.</p>
<p>You can assign access roles to specific users in your organization via the <strong>Security</strong> page. See <a href="#business_assign_roles_to_users">How do I assign security roles to users for my organization?</a> below.</p>
<p>You can also add roles. Currently, new roles must be added in Policy Manager, and are then available for selection in the API Platform UI. Roles added at the root organization level are available for all organizations; you can also add one or more roles for a specific organization, and they are available only for that organization.</p>
<p>For information on adding roles in Policy Manager, refer to the Policy Manager help.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>





<a name="business_assign_roles_to_users"></a><h3>How do I assign security roles to users for my organization?</h3>

  <li>Find your organization on the list, and then click the title to view the <strong>Details</strong> page for the organization.</li>
  <li>On the left navigation bar, choose <strong>Security</strong>. In the right pane, the <strong>Role Memberships</strong> page, all roles currently available to the organization are displayed. An example is shown below.
<p><img src="assets/security_role_memberships_hermosa.jpg" alt="Security role memberships" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>On the list, find the role you want to assign, and click the <strong>Edit</strong> (pencil) icon to the right. The {role name} - Users page has two panes:
    <ul>
      <li>Left pane has a search bar to help you identify one or more users you want to assign the role to.</li>
      <li>Right pane lists users currently assigned to the role.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>

<a name="business_get_business_id"></a><h3>How do I get the unique ID for my organization?</h3>

<p>In the developer portal, go to <strong>Organizations</strong> and click your organization to go to the <strong>Details</strong> page.</p>
<p>The URL will be something similar to the below:</p>
