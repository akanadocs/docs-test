<a name="business_security_manage"></a><h3>How do I manage security for my organization?</h3>
<p>The API platform allows you to assign one or more specific roles to users.</p>
<p>All roles defined in the underlying Policy Manager infrastructure, either for the root organization or for the current business organization, are available to be assigned to users in your organization.</p>
<p>This accommodates many use cases and allows you to assign rights to create, view, modify, and delete resources in your organization, to a very fine level of granularity. You can control user access rights to a much more detailed level than the Developer, API Admin, Business Admin, and Site Admin roles supported in versions of the API platform prior to version 8.3.</p>
<p>You can assign access roles to specific users in your organization via the <strong>Security</strong> page. See <a href="#business_assign_roles_to_users">How do I assign security roles to users for my organization?</a> below.</p>
<p>You can also add roles. Currently, new roles must be added in Policy Manager, and are then available for selection in the API Platform UI. Roles added at the root organization level are available for all organizations; you can also add one or more roles for a specific organization, and they are available only for that organization.</p>
<p>For information on adding roles in Policy Manager, refer to the Policy Manager help.</p>
