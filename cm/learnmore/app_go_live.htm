<a name="how_do_i_request_production_access_to_an_api"></a><h3>How do I request production access to an API?</h3>
<p>After you have determined tested your app and are ready to go to production, you must request access to the production endpoint for the API. This is accomplished using the <strong>API Access Wizard</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>API Access Wizard</em> (launched by selecting <strong>Access</strong> from the <em>API Details</em> page) is used to perform this task.</li>
  <li>The process involves selecting the app that is requesting API access, selecting the API Endpoint (Production), selecting licences that include SLA Policies for monitoring API performance, and reviewing and accepting the legal agreements relating to each API.</li>
  <li><em>Note: Before you can make a call to an API you must add credentials to your app. See <a href="app_create_app_security.htm#how_do_app_credentials_work">How do app credentials work?</a> for details.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Contract Generation and Approval</em>:</p>
<p>After the API Access Request is completed, a contract post is created and the request is submitted to the Admin Team for approval.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can view the contract in the <em>My Apps &gt; Board</em>.</li>
  <li>The contract is labeled as an &quot;API Access Request&quot; and is identified with a Contract Icon.</li>
  <li>If the request is automatically approved, the post status will display as &quot;Activated.&quot;</li>
  <li>If the request is not approved, the status will display as &quot;Pending Approval.&quot;</li>
  <li><em>Pending requests are reviewed and approved by the Admin Team.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you request access for the Production environment, an API Access Request contract is not created for the Sandbox environment.</li>
  <li>After the Production Access Request is approved, to gain access to the Sandbox environment, you must run the <strong>API Access</strong> function again to generate a new contract for the Sandbox environment.</li>
  <li>Note that contracts are cancelled when you switch environments. This means that new contracts must be generated using the <strong>API Access</strong> function each time you would like to switch Sandbox/Production environments.</li>
</ul>
<h5>To request access to the production endpoint:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Perform an API <em>Search</em> to target the API you would like to gain access to.</li>
  <li>Launch the <em>API Access Wizard</em> by selecting <strong>Access</strong> from the <em>API Board</em> page, or the <em>API Details</em> page. The <em>1. Select App</em> page of the <em>API Access Wizard</em> displays</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Add</strong> radio button of the App requesting access to the API. To sort the app information in ascending or descending order, click the App Name, Version, and Date columns.</li>
  <li>After making your selection, click <strong>Save</strong>, then <strong>Next</strong>. The <em>2. Endpoint</em> page displays.</li>
  <li>In the Environment section, click the radio button (Production) of the API endpoint you would like to request access to.</li>
  <li>After making your selection, click <strong>Save</strong>, then <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <em>3. Policies</em> page displays. Here you will select the Quality of Service (QoS) policies you would like to use to monitor the API service level. To select a policy, click the checkbox in the &quot;Select&quot; column of each policy you would like to assign to the current API. Note that this page displays only if policies are defined as part of the deployment.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to continue. If the current API includes published legal agreements, the <em>4. Legal Agreements</em> page displays.</li>
  <li>Review the <em>Legal Agreements</em> for the API and click<strong> Accept </strong>or <strong>Decline</strong>.</li>
  <li>The selected API may require acceptance to multiple legal agreements. If acceptance of multiple legal agreements is required, click on the tab to view each legal agreement. Note that all legal agreements must be accepted in order to proceed. If no additional legal agreements require acceptance, click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
  <li>The API Access Request is processed and an &quot;API Access Request&quot; ticket is posted to the <em>App Board</em> for the related app with a &quot;Pending&quot; status. The ticket is identified with a Contract Request Icon. The API is also visible in the <em>APIs Used</em> section of the <em>My Apps</em> page.</li>
  <li>The Access Request is also posted to the <em>APIs &gt; App</em> and <em>App &gt; APIs</em> pages with an <em>Access Requested</em> status. Upon approval by the API Admin, the API Access Request status will change to <em>Active</em>. Access to the API is granted and the API is visible in the <em>APIs Used</em> section of the <em>My Apps</em> page.</li>
  <li>After this step, you must add the production endpoint URL to your app. Refer to the API documentation in the <em>API &gt; Documents</em> section for more information.</li>

<a name="how_do_i_go_live_in_a_production_environment"></a><h3>How do I go live in a production environment?</h3>
<p>After the API Access Request for your app has been &quot;Approved&quot; and &quot;Activated&quot; the final step in the process is to Go Live. This is accomplished using the <strong>Switch to Production</strong> function on the <em>My Apps &gt; APIs : Connections</em> page.</p>
<h5>To go live in a production environment:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>My Apps &gt; App &gt; APIs</em>. Your app will display with an &quot;Activated&quot; status. If it still has an &quot;Approved&quot; status, this means that the API Provider has not yet approved your API Access Request.</li>
  <li>To go live with your app, click <strong>Switch to Production</strong>. The &quot;Switch to production request successful&quot; message displays. Your app is now live.</li>
</ol>

<a name="how_do_i_deactivate_my_apps_api_access_in_the_production_environment_after_i_go_live"></a><h3>How do I deactivate my app's API access in the production environment after I go live?</h3>
<p>If for any reason you would like to deactivate your live production environment, you can do so via the &quot;API access request from &lt;App Name&gt; (App Version) for &lt;API Name&gt; in production environment&quot; request located in your <em>Dashboard</em> or <em>App Board</em>.</p>
<h5>To deactivate your live production environment:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to your <em>Dashboard</em> or <em>App Board</em> and locate the &quot;API Access Request&quot; post associated with the app for which you would like to deactivate production.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Cancel</strong>.</li>

<a name="how_do_i_suspend_my_apps_api_access_in_the_production_environment_after_i_go_live"></a><h3>How do I suspend my app's API access in the production environment after I go live?</h3>
<p>If you would like to temporarily suspend your live app, you can do so using the suspend function. You can resume your go live state using the Resume function.</p>
<h5>To suspend API access in the production environment:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to your <em>Dashboard</em> or <em>App Board</em> and locate the &quot;API Access Request&quot; post associated with the app for which you would like to deactivate production.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Suspend</strong>. At the prompt, enter a comment and click <strong>Confirm</strong>. The app is suspended and the <strong>Resume</strong> button displays.</li>
</ol>

<a name="how_do_i_resume_my_apps_api_access_in_the_production_environment_after_i_suspend_it"></a><h3>How do I resume my app's API access in the production environment after I suspend it?</h3>
<p>If you have previously suspended your app's access to an API in the production environment, you can resume it using the <strong>Resume</strong> function.</p>
<h5>To resume API access in the production environment:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to your <em>Dashboard</em> or <em>App Board</em> and locate the &quot;API Access Request&quot; post associated with the app for which you would like to deactivate production.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Resume</strong>. A &quot;Resume this access request&quot; comment box displays. Enter a comment and click <strong>Confirm</strong>. The app goes live in the production environment.</li>
