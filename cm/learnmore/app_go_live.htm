<h3 id="how_do_i_request_api_access_live_implementation">How do I request access to the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementation for an API?</h3>
<p>After you've tested your app and are ready to launch, it's time to request access to the API's <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementation, using the <strong>API Access Wizard</strong>. See <a href="#proc_api_access_request_live">To request access to the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementation</a> below.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Before you can make a call to an API you must add credentials to your app. See <a href="app_create_app_security.htm#how_do_app_credentials_work">How do app credentials work?</a></p>
<p><strong>Contract Generation and Approval:</strong></p>
<p>After the API Access Request is made, it is sent to the API Admin for approval.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can view the contract: Go to<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_myapps_nav_all.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; choose app &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Forum</strong>.</li>
	<li>The contract is labeled as an &quot;API Access Request&quot; and is identified with a Contract Icon.</li>
	<li>If the request is automatically approved, the post status is <strong>Activated</strong>.</li>
	<li>If the request is not approved, the status is <strong>Pending Approval</strong>.</li>
	<li>Pending requests are reviewed and approved by the Admin Team.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>If you request access for the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementation, an API Access Request contract is not created for the Sandbox environment.</li>
	<li>After the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> Access Request is approved, to gain access to the Sandbox environment, you must run the <strong>API Access</strong> function again to generate a new contract for the Sandbox environment.</li>
	<li>Note that contracts are cancelled when you switch environments. This means that new contracts must be generated using the <strong>API Access</strong> function each time you would like to switch Sandbox/ <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementations.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="proc_api_access_request_live">To request access to the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementation:</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the Overview page for the API.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Access</strong>. The <strong>API Access Wizard</strong> opens at the <strong>Select App</strong> page.</li>
	<li>Find your app on the list, if there is more than one, and click the <strong>Add</strong> button.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the <strong>Endpoint</strong> page.</li>
	<li>Choose the implementation you're requesting access to, and then click <strong>Next</strong> or <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
	<li>Conditional: if there are <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy">policies</a>, the third page, <strong>Policies</strong>, is displayed. Here you will select the Quality of Service (QoS) policies you would like to use to monitor the API service level. To select a policy, click the check box in the &quot;Select&quot; column of each policy you would like to assign to the current API. This page displays only if policies are defined as part of the deployment.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Next</strong> or <strong>Save</strong>. If the current API includes one or more legal agreement, the <strong>Legal Agreements</strong> page is displayed.</li>
	<li>Review the legal agreements for the API and click <strong>Accept</strong> or <strong>Decline</strong>.</li>
	<li>The selected API might require acceptance to multiple legal agreements. If acceptance of multiple legal agreements is required, click on the tab to view each legal agreement. You must accept all legal agreements. If there are no additional legal agreements, click <strong>Submit</strong>. </li>
	</ol>
<p>The API Access Request is processed, and an <strong>API Access Request</strong> ticket is posted to the <strong>App Forum</strong> for the related app with a <strong>Pending</strong> status. The ticket is identified with a Contract Request Icon. The API is also visible in the <strong>APIs Connected</strong> section of the app's <strong>Details</strong> page.</p>
<p>The Access Request is also posted to the <strong>APIs</strong> &gt; <strong>App</strong> and <strong>App</strong> &gt; <strong>APIs</strong> pages with a status of <strong>Access Requested</strong>. Upon approval by the API Admin, the API Access Request status changes to <strong>Active</strong>. Access to the API is granted and the API is visible in the <strong>APIs Connected</strong> section of the app's <strong>Details</strong> page.</p>
<p>After this step, you must add the endpoint for the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementation to your app. Refer to the API documentation in the <strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Documentation</strong> section for more information.</p>
<p>For more information on managing connections, see <a href="app_access_apis_connections.htm#api_access_request_status_view">How do I see the status of my app's connections to APIs?</a></p>

<h3 id="how_do_i_switch_to_a_live_implementation">How do I switch to a <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementation?</h3>
<p>After the API Access Request for your app has been approved and activated, the final step is to go live.</p>
<h5>To go live</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Go to<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_myapps_nav_all.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; choose app &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>APIs</strong>. Your app is shown with an <strong>Activated</strong> status.
		<p>If it doesn't yet have <strong>Activated</strong> status, you'll need to wait for that before going live.</p></li>
	<li>To go live with your app, click <strong>Switch to <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --></strong>. The <strong>Switch to <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> request successful</strong> message displays. Your app is now live.</li>

<h3 id="how_deactivate_app_api_access_after_go_live">How do I deactivate my app's access to an API's <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementation?</h3>
<p>You can deactivate app access at any time.</p>
<h5>To deactivate your app's access to an API's <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementation:</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Go to your <strong>Dashboard</strong> or <strong>App Forum</strong> and locate the &quot;API Access Request&quot; notification associated with this contract.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Cancel</strong>.</li>
