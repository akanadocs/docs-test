<h3 id="how_can_i_see_a_quick_view_of_my_apps_performance">How can I see a quick view of my app's performance?</h3>
<p>The Apps &gt; <strong>Analytics</strong> &gt; <strong>Overview</strong> section includes a barometer-style Dashboard controls that  allows you to view  throughput, latency, and errors in real-time for your app's message traffic. Statistics are calculated  for all APIs that you app is connected to. You  can obtain statistics on a per-second or per-minute basis. The Dashboard displays statistics for the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>The App Analytics Dashboard rescales based on the number of messages received and the time interval selected (sec or min). For example, if your app sent 50 messages in the last 5 seconds, the scale changes to 0-60.</p>
<p>The App Analytics Dashboard provides the following control types:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Throughput:</strong> Provides statistics on the rate of successful message delivery.</li>
	<li><strong>Latency:</strong> Provides statistics on the amount of time it takes to process a message from source to destination.</li>
	<li><strong>Errors:</strong> Provides statistics on the number of errors incurred during message delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view data for API usage; you can also export the data. See <a href="#app_api_usage_export">How do I export API usage data for APIs that my App is connected to?</a></p>

<h3 id="how_do_i_monitor_app_performance">How do I monitor app performance?</h3>
<p>Performance charts are included in the <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; app &gt; <strong>Analytics</strong> &gt; <strong>Charts</strong> page. They provide a mechanism for all platform  members to view the performance of their apps and the APIs their apps are consuming. Chart data can be used to monitor API usage over time or to troubleshoot errors.</p>
<p>The Performance Chart functionality allows you to view performance in the Sandbox or Live implementations, and provides analytics for tracking service response time and transaction faults. Charts are populated by usage &quot;roll-up&quot; data that is gathered during the processing of web service request and response messages. Historic usage and performance data can be queried and viewed in the Usage Logs section. See <a href="#how_do_i_monitor_my_apps_api_usage_logs">How do I monitor my app's API usage logs?</a></p>
<p>Performance Charts automatically scale the Y axis to show an appropriate range for the data shown. You can choose to scale to the average based on the selected interval, or you can set your own scaling.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Updating of chart performance statistics using <strong>Refresh</strong> is based on your selected Duration and Interval, which together represents the total time range displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Chart Types</strong></p>
<p>The following performance chart types are supported for apps. All chart data is presented in milliseconds (ms).</p>

<h3 id="how_do_i_narrow_down_metric_information_app">How do I narrow down metric information for my app's usage logs or licenses?</h3>
<p>If you have a lot of transactions, you can use the <strong>Custom</strong> date range option to narrow down the time period. Custom date range includes hours, minutes, and seconds, so you can narrow down your logs or license charts to a range of seconds, to help you zero in on specific transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you use the <strong>Custom</strong> date range, the platform uses the time values from your local browser settings, converted to <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_coordinateduniversaltime">UTC</a> time.</p>
<h5>To narrow down metric information</h5>
<ol>
	<li>From the app's <strong>Details</strong> page, choose <strong>Analytics</strong> and then choose <strong>Logs</strong> or <strong>Licenses</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose the environment.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Interval</strong> drop-down and choose <strong>Custom</strong>, as shown below.
  <p><img src="assets/datepicker_app.jpg" alt="date picker" /></p></li>
	<li>Define start and end date/time, as shown below.
  <p><img src="assets/datepicker_custom.jpg" alt="date picker with custom date range" /></p></li>
	<li>Adjust the date range as needed until you have the transaction range you need.</li>
	<li>If needed, click <strong>Export</strong> to export the transactions to a ZIP file.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h3 id="app_api_usage_export">How do I export API usage data for APIs that my app is connected to?</h3>
<p>The analytics process captures your app's usage data for the APIs it is connected to. The <strong>API Usage</strong> section includes an <strong>Export</strong> function that allows you to export usage data  in a .csv file. You can open the&nbsp;.csv file in a selected application or download it. The export data is based on statistics gathered in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The export file is limited to a maximum of 10,000 records.</p>
<h5>To export usage data for an API that an app is connected to:</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Choose <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; specific app &gt; <strong>Analytics</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong>. </li>
	<li>On the right, click <strong>Expo</strong><strong>rt</strong>. The <strong>Opening applogs.csv</strong> dialog box displays.</li>

<h3 id="app_monitoring_by_license">What analytics information is available for monitoring my app's API usage by license?</h3>
<p>If your app is subscribed to APIs that offer specific licenses, you might want to monitor your app's API consumption for each license.</p>
<p>The platform allows you to monitor your app's quota usage to check that it isn't exceeding the quota defined by the license you selected for your contract with the API.</p>
<p>From the app's <strong>Details</strong> page, click <strong>Analytics</strong> on the left menu, and then click <strong>Licenses</strong>.</p>
<p>Analytics information will only show up if your app has one or more contracts with APIs that offer licenses with defined quotas of API usage.</p>
