<h3>How can I keep informed about my app?</h3>
<p>The platform offers the following app monitoring functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Charts and graphs</strong>: A set of monitoring charts and graphs for viewing, and in some cases exporting, your app's activity with the APIs it's using, including faults and transaction details. For full details, see <a href="#what_app_monitoring_information_is_available">What app monitoring information is available?</a></li>
  <li><strong>Dashboard notifications</strong> relating to the app. These are viewable via your Dashboard (see <a href="basics_navigation.htm#what_is_the_dashboard">What is the Dashboard?</a>), or via the App Board (see <a href="app_collaborate_app_board.htm#how_do_i_filter_information_in_the_app_board">How do I filter information in the App Board?</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>API-related email notifications</strong>: for information about the notification categories, and how to turn on and off email notifications, see <a href="basics_account_management.htm#how_do_i_enable_or_disable_email_notifications">How do I enable or disable email notifications?</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="what_app_monitoring_information_is_available"></a>
<h3>What app monitoring information is available?</h3>
<p>The platform includes a number of charts and logs to help you monitor your app's traffic with APIs it's using, from various different views. Chart data can be used to monitor your app's API usage over time or to troubleshoot errors. Usage logs that include request and response message data for message activity can be queried and viewed. See <a href="#how_do_i_monitor_app_performance">How do I monitor app performance?</a></p>
<p>From your <strong>App Details</strong> page, click <strong>Monitor</strong> on the left menu to access the monitoring features.</p>
<p>The options available are summarized in the table below.</p>

<a name="how_can_i_see_a_quick_view_of_my_apps_performance"></a>
<h3>How can I see a quick view of my app's performance?</h3>
<p>The <em>Apps &gt; Monitor  &gt; Overview</em> section includes a barometer-style Dashboard controls that  allows you to view  throughput, latency, and errors in real-time for your app's message traffic. Statistics are calculated  for all APIs that you app is connected to. You  can obtain statistics on a per-second or per-minute basis. The Dashboard displays statistics for the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>The App Monitoring Dashboard rescales based on the number of messages received and the time interval selected (sec or min). For example, if your app sent 50 messages in the last 5 seconds, the scale changes to 0-60.</p>
<p>The App Monitoring Dashboard provides the following control types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Throughput:</strong> Provides statistics on the rate of successful message delivery.</li>
  <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Provides statistics on the amount of time it takes to process a message from source to destination.</li>
  <li><strong>Errors:</strong> Provides statistics on the number of errors incurred during message delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view data for API usage; you can also export the data. See <a href="#how_do_i_export_api_usage_for_apis_that_my_app_is_connected_to">How do I export API usage data for APIs that my App is connected to?</a></p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_monitor_app_performance"></a><h3>How do I monitor app performance?</h3>
<p>Performance charts are included in the <em>My Apps &gt; Monitor &gt; Charts</em> page. They provide a mechanism for all platform  members to view the performance of their apps and the APIs their apps are consuming. Chart data can be used to monitor API usage over time or to troubleshoot errors.</p>
<p>The Performance Chart functionality allows you to view performance in sandbox or production modes, and provides monitoring for tracking service response time and transaction faults. Charts are populated by usage &quot;roll-up&quot; data that is gathered during the processing of web service request and response messages. Historic usage and performance data can be queried and viewed in the Usage Logs section. See <a href="#how_do_i_monitor_my_apps_api_usage_logs">How do I monitor my app's API usage logs?</a></p>
<p>Performance Charts automatically scale the Y axis to show an appropriate range for the data shown. You can choose to scale to the average based on the selected interval, or you can set your own scaling.</p>
<p><em>Note: Updating of chart performance statistics using <strong>Refresh</strong> is based on your selected Duration and Interval, which together represents the total time range displayed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chart Types</strong></p>
<p>The following performance chart types are supported for apps. All chart data is presented in milliseconds (ms).</p>
<table cellspacing="0px" class="doctable" style="width: 98%;">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Time Range</strong></p>
<p>The Performance Chart includes a navigation control, located at the bottom of the chart, which allows you to navigate the Timeline based on the selected Duration and Time Interval. Throughput data can also be monitored on the timeline and is presented in a spline chart.</p>
<p>After you have targeted a timeline, there are several ways to view additional chart detail. The <em>Zoom</em> feature allows you to view chart data by clicking on a pre-defined interval (1 hour, 3 hour, 6 hour, 12 hour, All). The Data Point Popup allows you to hover over a specific datapoint to view response data detail including Date, Time, Average, Max, and Min.</p>
<p><strong>Graph Controls</strong></p>
<p>The Graph Controls section of a Performance Chart
  provides options for configuring the chart content (a specific API or all APIs), data capture and display intervals (Duration and Interval), as well as navigating and zooming the chart Timeline. Each chart displays data based on the currently approved environment (Sandbox or Production).</p>

<p>The monitoring process captures your app's usage data for the APIs it is connected to. The <em>API Usage</em> section includes an <strong>Export</strong> function that allows you to export usage data  in a .csv file. You can open the .csv file in a selected application or download it. The export data is based on statistics gathered in the last 24 hours.</p>
<h5>To export usage data for APIs that an app is connected to:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>In the <em>API Usage </em>section on the <em>Apps &gt; Monitor &gt; Overview</em> screen, click <strong>Export</strong>. The <em>Opening export.csv</em> file dialog box displays.</li>
  <li>To open the .csv file in Microsoft  Excel or another selected application, click <strong>Open With</strong>.</li>
  <li>To download the .csv file, click <strong>Save File</strong>.</li>

<a name="app_monitoring_by_license"></a>
<h3>What information is available for monitoring my app's API usage by license?</h3>
<p>If your app is subscribed to APIs that offer specific licenses, you might want to monitor your app's API consumption for each license.</p>
<p>The platform allows you to monitor your app's quota usage to check that it isn't exceeding the quota defined by the license you selected for your contract with the API.</p>
<p>From your <strong>App Details</strong> page, click <strong>Monitor</strong> on the left menu to access the monitoring features, and then click <strong>Licenses</strong>.</p>
<p>Monitoring information will only show up if your app has one or more contracts with APIs that offer licenses with defined quotas of API usage.</p>
<p>The options available are summarized in the table below.</p>
<table cellspacing="0px" class="doctable" style="width: 98%;">

  <li>Log in and go to the App Details page for your app.</li>
  <li>Click <em>Monitor &gt; Licenses</em>.</li>

<a name="how_do_i_monitor_my_apps_performance_per_contract"></a>
<h3>How do I monitor my app's performance for a specific app/API contract?</h3>
<p>You can view monitoring charts and logs for any specific contract your app has with an API, as long as monitoring is turned on for the API.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the specified time period includes a point where the contract was revised, or suspended and resumed, or the contract was cancelled and a new one created, the chart or graph shows <strong>all</strong> transaction info between the app and the API in the selected time period. However, only in the case where the contract was revised, there is uninterrupted service. In other scenarios, service is suspended or stopped and is then resumed or restarted, with a period in between where the contract is not active.</p>
<h5>To monitor app performance for a specific contract:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in and go to the App Details page for your app.</li>
  <li>On the left menu, click <em>Monitor</em>.</li>
  <li>Choose one of the following options, to view contract information in different ways:
    <ul>
