<a name="what_are_connections"></a><h3>What are Connections?</h3>
<p>A Connection is a relationship or subscription between <em>Resources</em> (API, App, Group, Contract, User) in the system. When a Connection to a Resource is established, the Connection will appear in the appropriate collection point in for both Resources.</p>
<p>Connections are established in two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>When you create your app, connections to one or more APIs might be created automatically. If automatic connections are created, you can manage them in the same way as connections you create yourself (see #2 below).</li>
  <li>By sending a Connection Request. Each Connection Request follows a specific workflow process and a series of management tools are provided to control the lifecycle of the Connection. When a user creates a Connection to a Resource, the Resource administrators are notified of the pending request, and will see the Connection in the Connections Collection for the Resource. Users will also see the Connection in their personal Connections Collection.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if API Access is requested for one or more Apps, an entry for the API and App will appear on the <strong>API Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps</strong> and <strong>App Details</strong> &gt; <strong>APIs</strong> pages. Because these activities relate to specific Users (who are also considered Resources), feed entries associated with the activities are added to the <strong>Forum</strong> and <strong>Dashboard</strong> of both the API and App owner.</p>
<p>There are several types of connections:</p>

<a name="what_is_the_api_approval_process"></a><h3>What is the API approval process?</h3>
<p>When an API Access Request is submitted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A notification is posted on the API Administrator's <strong>Dashboard</strong> page.</li>
  <li>Forum entry:
    <ul>
      <li>A Forum entry is posted to the app's forum: <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>App</strong> &gt; <strong>Forum</strong>.</li>
      <li>A Forum entry is posted to the user's forum: top navigation bar &gt; <strong>Forum</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The API is added to <strong>My APIs</strong> &gt; API name &gt; <strong>Apps</strong> with a &quot;Pending Approval&quot; status.</li>
  <li>The API Administrator reviews the API Access Request.</li>
  <li>If the submitted API complies with the required approval criteria, the API Administrator approves the request, the ticket is updated to an &quot;Approved&quot; status, and the table entry for the API in <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>API Name</strong> &gt; <strong>APIs</strong> is updated to an &quot;Activated&quot; status.</li>
  <li>After API access is activated, you can use the API in the applicable environment.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how_do_i_see_the_status_of_my_apps_connections_to_apis"></a><h3>How do I see the status of my app's connections to APIs?</h3>
<p>You can review the status of your app's connections with APIs, including pending and active API access requests, in the <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>App</strong> &gt; <strong>APIs</strong> page. This page provides a high-level summary of the status of all current API access contracts and pending API access requests.</p>
<p>Each listing includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apps&#8212;The App Name. This link clicks through to the app's <strong>Details</strong> page.</li>
  <li>Legals&#8212;A column that indicates whether the Legal Agreements have been accepted (Check = Accepted, No Check = No Accepted).</li>
  <li>Sandbox / Live&#8212;Represent the two implementations that an API Access Request can be submitted for. Each column displays the current status of the API Access Request and available API management functions (for example, Cancel). The valid actions for a specific contract are determined by the current state of the contract; for example, only a contract in a state of Activated can be cancelled. For more information on API access states and valid actions, see <a href="site_admin_workflows.htm#what_is_the_default_workflow_for_api_contracts">What is the default workflow for API contracts?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The following table shows <em>App Status</em> and <em>App Management Tasks</em> for apps that have requested access to the current API using the <strong>API Access</strong> function:</p>

<a name="how_do_i_update_approved_api_access_requests"></a><h3>How do I update approved API Access Requests?</h3>
<p>You cannot modify an existing, approved or activated API access contract. Only the API Admin or Business Admin can modify a contract.</p>
<p>You can cancel or revise an existing contract. Follow the applicable step below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cancel</strong>: From the app's <strong>Details</strong> page, in the left menu bar, click <strong>APIs</strong>. Find the contract on the list; click the arrow to the right of the contract and choose <strong>Cancel</strong>. At the prompt, enter a comment and click <strong>Confirm</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Cancel</strong>: From the app's <strong>Details</strong> page, in the left menu bar, click <strong>APIs</strong>. Find the contract on the list; click the arrow to the right of the contract and choose <strong>Revise</strong>. The API Access Wizard opens. Change values as needed and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ul>
