<h2 id="settings_config_site">How do I configure site settings?</h2>
<p>Key values relating to your implementation of the developer portal, such as the contact email address used in emails and notifications sent out by the system, are generally set up as part of the Jython script that's run as part of installation. However, you might want to change one or more of these values later.</p>
<p>Some of these settings, you can configure in the <strong>Site Settings</strong> page.</p>
<p>You can also add or modify platform <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_theme">themes</a> on this page.</p>
<table class="doctable">

					<li><strong>Test Client calls</strong>: Default (*) means that Test Client will forward API calls to any valid host. When you specify one or more allowable hosts, Test Client will forward API calls only to these trusted hosts.</li>
					<li><strong>Test Client OAuth requests</strong>: (Version 2019.0.2 and later, 2018.0.15 and later) This setting is also used for validating OAuth requests in Test Client, to prevent server-side request forgery (SSRF). If this field is set to allow only specified hosts, Test Client only processes OAuth requests to these trusted hosts.</li>
					<li><strong>File upload</strong>: This setting also affects file upload in the developer portal. For example, if you specify trusted hosts, an API Admin can only upload an API description document from an external URL if the host is trusted. See <a href="apiadmin_api_add.htm#how_do_i_add_an_api_using_a_d_d">How do I add an API using an API description document?</a></li>

					<li>Host name without sub-domain and domain (<strong>ubu14234-9</strong>).</li>
					<li>Asterisk used as a wild card to indicate any domain address (<strong>*</strong>). This is the default value.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Note</strong>: There is a setting in the Akana Administration Console relating to forward proxy hosts, and that field takes precedence over this one. It must be set to the default, * (allow all) in order for values specified in the developer portal site settings to apply.

<h2 id="theme_platform_define">What is a platform theme?</h2>
<p>One theme is one instance of the developer portal, with a unique URL and a specific look and feel. As part of site configuration, the Site Admin has the option to configure more than one theme for the implementation. There are several themes available: see <a href="#settings_theme_options">What themes are available?</a></p>
<p>You can define a separate instance for each theme; in addition, you can extend a theme, to create one or more custom themes that are based on the same standard theme. Each custom theme can then be modified independently of the others, so that there can be multiple instances of the same theme with different sets of customization applied to each.</p>
<p>When creating the tenant, it's best to choose one theme, such as Hermosa, as a starting point. The Site Admin can create additional themes later, in the developer portal: <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Site</strong> &gt; <strong>Add Theme</strong>.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="site_admin_site.htm#settings_theme_add">How do I add a theme?</a> and <a href="site_admin_site.htm#settings_theme_clone">How do I extend a platform theme?</a></p>

<h2 id="settings_theme_add">How do I add a theme?</h2>
<p>You can add one or more <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_theme">themes</a> in the <strong>Site Settings</strong> page.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> (2020.1.0 and later): When you add or modify a theme, and save the updates in the <strong>Site Settings</strong> page, the platform generates default customization files for all current themes. If you have customization files already in place, those files are not affected. The default customization files, sometimes called scaffolding, are generated to help support any customization you might want to do in the future. </p>

<h2 id="settings_theme_clone">How do I extend a platform theme?</h2>
<h4 class="stamp">Valid in Version: 2018.0.0</h4>
<p>The developer portal includes several out-of-the-box standard themes. For a full list, see <a href="#settings_theme_options">What themes are available?</a></p>
<p>You can extend a standard theme by defining one or more custom themes based on the same standard theme. By doing this, you can have two or more instances of the same platform theme, each with its own URL and potentially each with a different set of user-defined customizations. Each instance uses the same database.</p>
<p>You can use this to define multiple access points into the platform, each with its own set of customizations applied.</p>
<p><strong>Sample scenario illustrating multiple customizations of look and feel:</strong></p>
<p>Tenant ACMEPayments Corp has 10 partners; each partner has a different API on the platform, and each has an API admin who accesses the platform and exports metric information for the API.
</p>
<p>When installing, the Site Admin defines ten custom themes, each based on <strong>Hermosa</strong> theme, each named for one of the 10 partners, and each with a different URL that includes the tenant name and partner name.</p>
<p>After defining one or more custom themes, the Site Admin applies the customization by uploading a <strong>custom.less</strong> file for each partner with the partner's company colors and logo.</p>
<p>When each API Admin logs in via the URL for his company, he sees the colors and logo for his company.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For instructions, see <a href="#settings_theme_add">How do I add a theme?</a> In Step 4, choose <strong>Custom Theme</strong>.</li>
	<li>You'll need to have a unique URL for each theme.</li>
	<li>Each instance with a separate <strong>theme</strong> value can be customized later with a <strong>custom.less</strong> file. See <a href="site_admin_customization.htm#platform_styles_customize">I want to customize platform styles. What do I do?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="settings_theme_edit">How do I edit a theme?</h2>
<p>You can edit a theme in the <strong>Site Settings</strong> page.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> (2020.1.0 and later): When you add or modify a theme, and save the updates in the <strong>Site Settings</strong> page, the platform generates default customization files for all current themes. If you have customization files already in place, those files are not affected.

<h2 id="settings_theme_security_manage">How do I manage security for a developer portal theme?</h2>
<h4 class="stamp">Valid in Version: 2018.0.0 and later</h4>
<p>The platform uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) for secure communications. It also supports SNI (Server Name Indication), an extension to TLS. You can use the platform's SNI support to add your own certificate to a theme.</p>
<p>By default, each tenant on the platform is protected by the platform's security certificate. However, by adding SNI support for your own tenant, you can use your own certificate. When customers access your theme in the browser, they'll see your own certificate rather than the default Akana platform certificate.</p>
<p>When SNI is in place, your consumers can use your own certificate rather than the default platform certificate for SSL termination.</p>
<p>To implement SNI for your tenant, upload and assign a PKCS12 security certificate and assign it to your developer portal theme.</p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Upload a security certificate and assign it to a specific theme: see <a href="#settings_theme_security_add">How do I add security to a theme?</a>
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: The cert <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_cn">CN</a> (Common Name) must match the site virtual host.</p></li>
	<li>View the security certificate that's assigned to a theme: see <a href="#settings_theme_security_cert_view">How do I view the security certificate for a theme?</a></li>
	<li>Edit a certificate that's assigned to a theme (essentially, replace it with a new one): see <a href="#settings_theme_security_update">How do I update the security for a theme?</a></li>
	<li>Download an existing certificate: see <a href="#settings_theme_security_download">How do I download an existing certificate already assigned to a theme?</a></li>
	<li>Delete the certificate assigned to a theme: see <a href="#settings_theme_security_delete">How do I delete the certificate assigned to a theme?</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: The cert must be a trusted certificate; therefore, its certification path must be in the platform's <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_truststore">trust store</a>. See <a href="#sec_cert_to_trust_store">How do I get my security certificate added to the platform's trust store?</a></p>
<p>For on-premise implementations only: If you get the below error message, you'll need to first set up an HTTPS listener in Policy Manager, the underlying infrastructure:</p>

<p>To get the certificate added to the platform's trust store:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you're using the SaaS (Software as a Service) Cloud platform, write a Support ticket to get your certificate added.</li>
	<li>If you have an on-prem installation, you must define it in Policy Manager so that trust is established. For instructions, see <a href="../../ag/security_config/trusted_ca_certificates.htm">Import CA Certificate</a> (Policy Manager help).</li>
