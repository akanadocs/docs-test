<h3 id="settings_config_site">How do I configure site settings?</h3>
<p>Key values relating to your implementation of the developer portal, such as the contact email address used in emails and notifications sent out by the system, are generally set up as part of the Jython script that's run as part of installation. However, you might want to change one or more of these values later.</p>
<p>Some of these settings, you can configure in the <strong>Site Settings</strong> page.</p>
<p>You can also add or modify platform <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_theme">themes</a> on this page.</p>
<table class="doctable">
	<thead>

	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Name</td>
			<td><p>A friendly name for the tenant (can be more than one word), used in emails and notifications that are sent out by the system. It should reflect the name of your site.</p>

				<p>This setting also affects file upload in the developer portal. For example, if you specify trusted hosts, an API Admin can only upload an API description document from an external URL if the host is trusted. See <a href="apiadmin_api_add.htm#how_do_i_add_an_api_using_a_d_d">How do I add an API using an API description document?</a></p>

<h3 id="cdf_supported">What custom date formats does the platform support?</h3>
<h5 class="stamp">API Platform Version: 8.4.8 and later</h5>
<p>The platform supports the date formats shown below. To enter a custom date format in the Site Settings, just type, or copy and paste, and then click <strong>Save</strong>. See <a href="#custom_date_format_add">How do I specify a custom date format?</a> below.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Do not specify the hours, minutes, and seconds. The platform adds those automatically. Just specify the date format.</p>
<p>Supported date and time patterns:</p>
<ul>
	<li>yy = short year</li>
	<li>yyyy = long year</li>
	<li>M = month (1-12)</li>
	<li>MM = month (01-12)</li>
	<li>MMM = month abbreviation (Jan, Feb ... Dec)</li>
	<li>MMMM = long month (January, February ... December)</li>
	<li>d = day (1 - 31)</li>
	<li>dd = day (01 - 31)</li>
	<li>ddd = day of the week in words (Monday, Tuesday ... Sunday)</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li>dd/MM/yyyy = 31/08/2017</li>
	<li>M/d/yy = 8/31/17</li>
</ul>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you change the date format, browser restart is needed for the change to take effect.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h3 id="custom_date_format_add">How do I specify a custom date format?</h3>
<h5 class="stamp">API Platform Version: 8.4.8 and later</h5>
<p>The platform displays dates in several places; for example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the title bar under Last Logged In</li>
	<li>In the Dashboard and Forum, for forum entries</li>
	<li>In app and API analytics (charts and logs)</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the platform takes the date format based on the locale setting for the user's browser; so, for example, on 7 September 2017, with the US setting (en-us), the Last Logged In date would show as 7/9/17, and with the UK setting (en-gb) it would show as 9/7/17. The location of this setting varies by browser; for example, in Mozilla Firefox, it's in <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Content</strong> &gt; <strong>Languages</strong>. Generally, browser restart is needed for a change to take effect.</p>
<p>The platform includes a setting that allows the Site Admin to override the browser default, so that the date format displayed in the developer portal is consistent for all users.</p>

<h5 id="proc_custom_date_format">To specify a custom date format:</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Log in as the Site Admin and <a href="site_admin_overview.htm#admin_menu_siteadmin">go to the Admin section</a>.</li>
	<li>Go to <strong>Site</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Custom Date Format</strong> field, type the new format. For a list of supported formats, see <a href="#cdf_supported">What custom date formats does the platform support?</a></li>
	<li>When done, click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do not specify the hours, minutes, and seconds. The platform adds those automatically. Just specify the date format.</li>
	<li>The developer portal converts the time zone specified for the operating system into the local browser time format.</li>
	<li>If the date format specified in the browser <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_locale">locale</a> (language) settings doesn't match one of the date format supported ( see <a href="#cdf_supported">What custom date formats does the platform support?</a>), the format used in the developer portal defaults to <strong>MM/dd/yy HH:mm</strong>, the standard US date format.</li>
	<li>Browser restart is needed for a change in date format to take effect.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="settings_theme_clone">How do I extend a platform theme?</h3>
<h5 class="stamp">API Platform Version: 2018.0.0</h5>
<p>The developer portal has three out-of-the-box standard themes: <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_theme_default">Default Theme</a>, <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_theme_simpledev">Simple Dev</a>, and <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_theme_hermosa">Hermosa</a>.</p>
<p>You can extend a standard theme by defining one or more custom themes based on the same standard theme. By doing this, you can have two or more instances of the same platform theme, each with its own URL and potentially each with a different set of user-defined customizations. Each instance uses the same database.</p>
<p>You can use this to define multiple access points into the platform, each with its own set of customizations applied via the <strong>custom.less</strong> file.</p>
<p><strong>Sample scenario illustrating multiple customizations of look and feel:</strong></p>
<p>Tenant ACMEPayments Corp has 10 partners; each partner has a different API on the platform, and each has an API admin who accesses the platform and exports metric information for the API.
</p>
<p>When installing, the Site Admin defines ten custom themes, each based on <strong>Hermosa</strong> theme, each named for one of the 10 partners, and each with a different URL that includes the tenant name and partner name.</p>
<p>After defining one or more custom themes, the Site Admin applies the customization by uploading a <strong>custom.less</strong> file for each partner with the partner's company colors and logo.</p>
<p>When each API Admin logs in via the URL for his company, he sees the colors and logo for his company.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For instructions, see <a href="#settings_theme_add">How do I add a theme?</a> In Step 4, choose <strong>Custom Theme</strong>.</li>
	<li>You'll need to have a unique URL for each theme.</li>
	<li>Each instance with a separate <strong>theme</strong> value can be customized later with a <strong>custom.less</strong> file. See <a href="site_admin_config.htm#i_want_to_customize_platform_styles">I want to customize platform styles. What do I do?</a></li>

<h3 id="settings_theme_security_manage">How do I manage security for a developer portal theme?</h3>
<h5 class="stamp">API Platform Version: 2018.0.0 and later</h5>
<p>The platform uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) for secure communications. It also supports SNI (Server Name Indication), an extension to TLS. You can use the platform's SNI support to add your own certificate to a theme.</p>
<p>By default, each tenant on the platform is protected by the platform's security certificate. However, by adding SNI support for your own tenant, you can use your own certificate. When customers access your theme in the browser, they'll see your own certificate rather than the default Akana platform certificate.</p>
<p>When SNI is in place, your consumers can use your own certificate rather than the default platform certificate for SSL termination.</p>
<p>To implement SNI for your tenant, upload and assign a PKCS12 security certificate and assign it to your developer portal theme.</p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Upload a security certificate and assign it to a specific theme: see <a href="#settings_theme_security_add">How do I add security to a theme?</a>
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: The cert <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_cn">CN</a> (Common Name) must match the site virtual host.</p></li>
	<li>View the security certificate that's assigned to a theme: see <a href="#settings_theme_security_cert_view">How do I view the security certificate for a theme?</a></li>
	<li>Edit a certificate that's assigned to a theme (essentially, replace it with a new one): see <a href="#settings_theme_security_update">How do I update the security for a theme?</a></li>
	<li>Download an existing certificate: see <a href="#settings_theme_security_download">How do I download an existing certificate already assigned to a theme?</a></li>
	<li>Delete the certificate assigned to a theme: see <a href="#settings_theme_security_delete">How do I delete the certificate assigned to a theme?</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: The cert must be a trusted certificate; therefore, its certification path must be in the platform's trust store. See <a href="#sec_cert_to_trust_store">How do I get my security certificate added to the platform's trust store?</a></p>
<p>For on-premise implementations only: If you get the below error message, you'll need to first set up an HTTPS listener in Policy Manager, the underlying infrastructure:</p>
<pre>No available HTTPS listeners.</pre>
<p>To set up the listener, see <a href="../../ag/listeners/about_listeners.htm#proc_listener_add">Adding a Listener</a> (Policy Manager help).</p>

<h3 id="settings_theme_security_add">How do I add security to a theme?</h3>
<h5 class="stamp">API Platform Version: 2018.0.0</h5>
<p>Once you've added a site theme, you can upload a <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_certificate">certificate</a> to add security to the theme.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: The certificate must be a trusted certificate; therefore, its certification path must be in the platform's trust store. See <a href="#sec_cert_to_trust_store">How do I get my security certificate added to the platform's trust store?</a></p>
<p>In general, changes that you make to a theme aren't saved until you click <strong>Save</strong>; however, certificates are an exception. When you upload the security certificate, it's attached to the theme immediately. </p>

<h3 id="sec_cert_to_trust_store">How do I get my security certificate added to the platform's trust store?</h3>
<p>If you're adding or updating a certificate for your theme, you'll need to make sure that the certification path is in the platform's trust store. This is required so that the certificate is a trusted certificate.</p>
<p>To get the certificate added to the platform's trust store:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you're using the SaaS (Software as a Service) Cloud platform, write a Support ticket to get your certificate added.</li>
	<li>If you have an on-prem installation, you must define it in Policy Manager so that trust is established. For instructions, see <a href="../../ag/security_config/trusted_ca_certificates.html">Import CA Certificate</a> (Policy Manager help).</li>

<h5 class="stamp">API Platform Version: 2018.0.0</h5>
<p>Most values associated with a site theme are updated only when you click <strong>Save</strong> on the <strong>Site Settings</strong> page. However, when you make changes to security keys/certificates, the changes are effective immediately. Deleting the security certificate for a site theme removes a layer of security; be sure that you want to perform this action. If you're planning to add a new certificate, you could leave the existing certificate in place and then just upload the new one, to ensure there is no lapse in site security; see <a href="#settings_theme_security_update">How do I update the security for a theme?</a></p>

<h3 id="lm_integration_ms_sql">Lifecycle Manager: special instructions for running with MS SQL</h3>
<p>When the API Platform is using a Microsoft SQL Server database, when you initially enable the option in the Site Settings (see <a href="#site_settings_lm_integration">Extended Properties and Workflow</a>), this action fails to create the backing Lifecycle Manager library for the tenant.</p>
<p>To address this issue, you'll need to enable a setting in the Akana Administration Console for the container, before enabling the <strong>Extended Properties and Workflow</strong> site setting. Follow the steps below.</p>

<h5 id="proc_enable_synch_lm_data">To enable synchronization of Lifecycle Manager data in the Akana Administration Console</h5>

	<li>In the Akana Administration Console, on the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab, under <strong>Configuration Actions</strong>, choose <strong>Synchronize Lifecycle Manager Data</strong>. The wizard opens.</li>
	<li>Enter the name of a specific tenant, or leave empty for all tenants, and run the configuration action.</li>
	<li>When done, click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information on running this configuration action, see <a href="../../sp/admin_console/config_actions.htm#aac_ca_synch_lm_data" title="Synchronize Lifecycle Manager Data">Synchronize Lifecycle Manager Data</a> (Admin Console documentation).</p>
