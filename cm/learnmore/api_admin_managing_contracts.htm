<a name="how_do_i_see_the_status_of_my_apis_contracts_with_apps"></a><h3>How do I see the status of my API's contracts with apps?</h3>
<p>You can review the status of your API's connections, including pending and active API access requests, in the <em>My APIs &gt; API &gt; Apps</em> page. This page provides a high level summary of workflow status for apps with current API access contracts or pending API access requests for the current API.</p>
<p>Each listing includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apps&#8212;The App Name. This link clicks through to the <em>App Details</em> page.</li>
  <li>Legals&#8212;A column that indicates whether the Legal Agreements have been accepted (Check = Accepted, No Check = No Accepted).</li>
  <li>Sandbox / Production&#8212;Represent the two environments that an API Access Request can be submitted for. Each column displays the current status of the API Access Request and available API management functions (for example, Cancel, Suspend, Resume, Request Access, Switch to Production). The valid actions for a specific contract are determined by the current state of the contract; for example, only a contract that is currently in a state of Suspended can be resumed, and only a contract in a state of Activated can be cancelled. For more information on API access states and valid actions, see <a href="business_admin_workflows.htm#what_is_the_default_workflow_for_api_contracts">What is the default workflow for API contracts?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The following tables provide explanations for information you might see on this page.</p>

<a name="how_do_i_revise_a_contract"></a><h3>How do I revise a contract?</h3>
<p>When a contract that an app has with your API is approved and/or activated, you can still revise the contract to modify the licenses or make other changes as needed.</p>
<p>When you revise an active contract, the platform creates a new contract based on the existing one. You can then modify the properties as needed. When the new contract is activated, the original version is automatically cancelled, and the new contract becomes the active contract. There is no interruption of traffic for the contract, and the metrics for the contract continue to increment.</p>
<h5>To revise a contract:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to My APIs, choose the API, and then, in the left navigation, click Apps.</li>
  <li>Locate the contract on the list.</li>
  <li>To the right of the entry, click the icon to view the list of options for the contract, and choose <strong>Revise</strong>.</li>
  <li>Revise the contract as needed.</li>
  <li>Save changes.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_export_a_specific_contract_for_my_api"></a><h3>How do I export a specific contract for my API?</h3>
<p>You can export all the API contracts for your API when you export the API via the Export button on the API Details page (see <a href="api_admin_api_publishing.htm#how_do_i_export_an_api">How do I export an API?</a>).</p>
<p>However, you might want to export a specific contract. You can do that via the My APIs &gt; API &gt; Apps page, where you can view the contracts for all apps that are connected to your API.</p>
<h5>To export an individual contract for an API:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to My APIs, choose the API, and then, in the left navigation, click Apps.</li>
  <li>Locate the contract on the list.</li>
  <li>To the right of the entry, click the icon to view the list of options for the contract, and choose <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
  <li>On the Export overlay, check the boxes to include the following in the export file:
    <ul>
      <li>API</li>
      <li>Application</li>
      <li>License</li>
      <li>Policies</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  
  <li>Click <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
  <li>Choose to save or open the export file (apicontract-export.zip).</li>
</ol>

<a name="what_are_the_contents_of_the_api_contract_export_file"></a>
<h3>What are the contents of the API contract export file?</h3>
<p>The API contract export file includes all the core information about the API/app contract, as well as any of the optional additional information you specified.</p>
<p>The export file will generally include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Files at root level: 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>objectgraph.xml</strong>: An XML file that shows the relationships between resources.</li>
      <li><strong>objectdata.xml</strong>: An XML-based  summary of all the data in the export file.</li>
      <li><strong>exportproperties.properties</strong>: a properties file showing which options were included in the export file.</li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>bpels</strong>: a folder containing XML business process files (<a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_bpel_file">bpel files</a>). One for each operation, for each environment. So, for example, if the API has five operations, and runs in Sandbox and Production environments, there are 10 bpel files.</li>
  <li><strong>services</strong>: a folder containing a subfolder for each environment, each subfolder containing a bpel.xml file for the applicable service/environment.</li>
  <li><strong>wsdls</strong>: a folder containing WSDL files for the service.</li>
</ul>
