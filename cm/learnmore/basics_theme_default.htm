<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Default Theme is deprecated in Version 2020.1.0 and removed in Version 2020.2.0.</p>
<p>Default theme was the version of the user interface most commonly used until the advent of the Hermosa theme in version 8.2.</p>
<p>In versions that support Default Theme, this  theme supports full functionality of the Community Manager developer portal, including Administrator tasks.</p>
