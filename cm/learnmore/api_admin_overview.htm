  <li>Manage tickets associated with the API, including opening, modifying, closing, and deleting tickets and changing ticket status.</li>

  <li>Upload legal agreements for the API.</li>
  <li>Manage a <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_privateapigroup">Private API Group</a>, including creating the group, inviting one or more members, changing a member's role, and modifying or deleting the group.</li>
  <li>Invite <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_independentgroup">independent groups</a> to connect with the API.</li>
  <li>Manage API access requests including granting an app's request for API access and suspending or cancelling API access.</li>
  <li>Make changes to the API including modifying the API, adding, modifying, or deleting API versions, or deleting the API.</li>
  <li>Monitor API performance including monitoring volume and looking at detailed information about the messages being processed, such as headers.</li>

<h3>What are the differences between API Admin and Business Admin roles?</h3>
<p>In a <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_tenant">tenant</a> scenario, a user who is a Business Admin for the tenant has full permission to all objects within the tenant business, including all apps and APIs.</p>
<p>The Business Admin has the same rights as the API Admin, plus additional rights and responsibilities.</p>
