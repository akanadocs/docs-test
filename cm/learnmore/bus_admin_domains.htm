<h2 id="domain_types_overview">What domain types are supported on the platform?</h2>
<p>The security domains configured on the platform can be used in multiple contexts, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Login domain, for logging in to the portal</li>
	<li>Resource owner domain, for OAuth resource owners</li>
	<li>App authentication in API runtime, for sending API requests</li>
</ul>
<p>One domain can be used for multiple purposes, or separate domains can be configured for separate purposes.</p>
<p>When a specific domain is configured for the purpose of developer logins to the portal, it is called a <strong>login domain</strong>.</p>
<p>The table below shows supported domains and how they are used.</p>

<h2 id="domain_add">How do I add a domain?</h2>
<h4>To add a domain:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in as the Business Admin and <a href="bus_admin_overview.htm#admin_menu_busadmin">go to the Admin section</a>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Domains</strong>. The <strong>Domains Summary</strong> page displays.</li>
	<li>On the right, click <strong>Add Domain</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose from the supported domain types, and then follow the applicable setup instructions. See <a href="#domain_types_overview">What domain types are supported on the platform?</a> above.
	</li>
	<li>When the domain is set up, if you want to offer it for login you must enable it as a separate configuration step. See <a href="bus_admin_domains.htm#domain_login_enable">How do I enable a domain for login?</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In some implementations of the platform, there could be a custom Business Admin role that can view domains but cannot add, modify, or delete. For more information, see <a href="#domain_view_only">Why can't I add a domain?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="domain_modify">How do I modify a domain?</h2>
<h4>To modify a domain:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in as the Business Admin and <a href="bus_admin_overview.htm#admin_menu_busadmin">go to the Admin section</a>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Domains</strong>. The <strong>Domains Summary</strong> page displays.</li>
	<li>Find the domain on the list and click <strong>Modify</strong>. The <strong>Edit</strong> wizard for the specific domain type displays.</li>
	<li>Follow the setup instructions for the specific domain type. The process for editing is similar to the process for adding a domain, although some fields, such as the domain name, cannot be changed. See <a href="#domain_types_overview">What domain types are supported on the platform?</a> above.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In some implementations of the platform, there could be a custom Business Admin role that can view domains but cannot add, modify, or delete. For more information, see <a href="#domain_view_only">Why can't I add a domain?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="domain_delete">How do I delete a domain?</h2>
<h4>To delete a domain:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in as the Business Admin and <a href="bus_admin_overview.htm#admin_menu_busadmin">go to the Admin section</a>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Domains</strong>. The <strong>Domains Summary</strong> page displays.</li>
	<li>In the right-hand column of the domain line item, click <strong>Delete</strong>. At the confirmation message, click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Rather than deleting a domain, you might choose to disable the domain for login, in the Config options. For instructions, see <a href="site_admin_config.htm#how_do_i_disable_a_platform_login">How do I disable a platform login?</a></p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="domain_login_set_up">How do I set up a login domain?</h2>
<p>To make a login domain available to users for logging in to the platform, you must perform two steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Configure the applicable domain:<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Domains</strong>. Domains applicable to login are:
		<ul>
			<li>Platform Login: see <a href="#domain_login_configure">How do I configure a Platform Login domain?</a></li>
			<li>Facebook Connector: see <a href="#domains_login_setup_facebook">How do I configure a Facebook Connector domain?</a></li>
			<li>Google Connector: see <a href="#domain_google_connector_configure">How do I configure a Google Connector domain?</a></li>
			<li>OpenID Connect Relying Party: see <a href="bus_admin_domains_oidc.htm#domain_setup_openid_connect_relying_party">How do I set up the platform to log in with an OpenID Connect Relying Party domain?</a></li>
			<li>LDAP: see <a href="#domain_ldap_configure">How do I set up an LDAP domain?</a></li>
			<li>CA SiteMinder: see <a href="#domains_login_setup_ca_siteminder">How do I set up the platform to log in with CA SiteMinder (CA SiteMinder domain)?</a></li>
			<li>SAML Web SSO: see <a href="#domains_login_setup_saml_web_sso">How do I set up the platform to log in with SAML Web SSO?</a></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li>Enable the domain for login. This is a configuration step:<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Logins</strong> (<strong>Enable</strong> check box). For more information, see <a href="bus_admin_domains.htm#domain_login_enable">How do I enable a domain for login?</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Once these two steps are complete, the login options you've configured and enabled are available for anyone logging in to the platform.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="domain_login_enable">How do I enable a domain for login?</h2>
<p>To make a login domain available to users for logging in to the platform, two steps are needed:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Business Admin: Configure the applicable domain:<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Domains</strong>. For information about domains that are applicable to login, see <a href="#domain_types_overview">What domain types are supported on the platform?</a></li>
	<li>Site Admin: Enable the domain for login:<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Logins</strong> (<strong>Enable</strong> check box). See <a href="site_admin_config.htm#how_do_i_enable_and_customize_a_login_domain">How do I enable and customize a platform login domain?</a> (Site Admin help).</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="domain_login_configure">How do I configure a Platform Login  domain?</h2>
<p>Installation of the platform automatically creates a Platform Login domain. This login domain type allows users who have signed up on the platform to log in via the default platform login page using their email and password login credentials.</p>
<p>Although the Platform Login domain is created automatically, it must still be enabled for login by the Site Admin. This is a configuration step:<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Logins</strong> page (<strong>Enable</strong> check box). For more information, see <a href="bus_admin_domains.htm#domain_login_enable">How do I enable a domain for login?</a></p>
<p>The default Platform Login domain cannot be deleted.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="domain_ldap_configure">How do I set up an LDAP domain?</h2>
<p>The platform provides support for users logging in using LDAP credentials.</p>
<p>You must first define the LDAP domain in the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy_manager">Policy Manager</a> Management Console, in <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Identity Systems</strong>. For more information, refer to the <strong>Add Identity System</strong> (Active Directory) topic in the Policy Manager Online Help.</p>
<p>Once the domain is defined in Policy Manager, you can enable it for login in Akana API Platform. See <a href="site_admin_config.htm#p_enable_login_domain">To enable a login domain</a>.</p>
<p>Once setup is complete, when users sign in they will see the LDAP icon on the platform login page and will be able to choose LDAP for login.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="domain_oidc_provider">How do I set up an OpenID Connect Provider domain?</h2>
<p>If you're setting up an OpenID Connect Provider domain, you'll need to choose the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain option (<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Domains</strong> &gt; <strong>Add Domain</strong> &gt; choose <strong>Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider</strong>). For full instructions, see <a href="#domain_oauth_provider_configure">How do I set up and configure an Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain?</a></p>
<p>There are some differences between an <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_oauth_provider">Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider</a> and an <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_openidconnect_provider">OpenID Connect Provider</a>; for example, OpenID Connect has the userinfo endpoint. The platform's Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain option accommodates both.</p>
<p>Some points to note:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Authentication domain</strong>: You must already have set up a resource owner authentication domain, such as an LDAP domain, for user authentication. The OpenID Connect Provider domain you set up will reference the existing authentication domain for user authentication.</li>
	<li><strong>Tab 4, OpenID Connect</strong>, is where you specify that this is an OpenID Connect Provider domain. In addition, if you need to define additional scopes for your domain, add them here.</li>
	<li><strong>Tab 6, Branding</strong>: You'll need to specify the authorization server URL.</li>
	<li>If you just want to use OpenID Connect to authenticate the resource owner, you don't need a Provider domain at all. Instead, choose the OpenID Relying Party Domain (see <a href="bus_admin_domains_oidc.htm#domain_openid_connect_relying_party_config">How do I configure an OpenID Connect Relying Party domain?</a>). The OAuth / OpenID Connect Provider domain is the one to choose if you want to use the platform as an OpenID Connect Provider, issuing tokens and granting access to resources.</li>
	<li>The userinfo endpoint for the domain is: {authorization_server_url}/oauth/userinfo. For example, if the authorization server URL is <strong>https://www.myauthorizationserver:9800</strong>, the userinfo endpoint is <strong>https://www.myauthorizationserver:9800/oauth/userinfo</strong>. See <a href="#domain_oauth_provider_authserverurl">Authorization Server URL</a> (help for <strong>Branding</strong> tab).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the domain is set up, you can associate it with an API and test it in Test Client to make sure everything is working as expected.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="oidcrp_domain_or_eoap_domain">Do I choose the OpenID Connect Relying Party domain or the External OAuth Provider domain?</h2>
<p>Both these domain options, OpenID Connect Relying Party and External OAuth Provider, allow you to reference an external OAuth / OpenID Connect provider. So, how do you determine which option is best for you?</p>
<p>These two options are used for different purposes, and collect different information. Essentially it depends on your purpose, authenticating users or securing OAuth requests:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If you want to use an external OpenID Connect provider to authenticate end users</strong>: choose the OpenID Connect Relying Party domain.</li>
	<li><strong>If you want to use an external OAuth Provider to secure API requests</strong>: choose the External OAuth Provider domain.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>




<h2 id="pf_domain_or_eoap_domain">Do I choose the PingFederate domain or the External OAuth Provider domain?</h2>
<p>If you are using PingFederate, you have two domain options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>PingFederate add-on/PingFederate domain: You can install the PingFederate add-on in Policy Manager and then set up a PingFederate domain in the Akana API Platform</li>
	<li>External OAuth Provider: You can set up an External OAuth Provider domain in the Akana API Platform (no Policy Manager setup required).</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly recommend you choose External OAuth Provider, which requires less setup and includes additional features.</p>
<p>The platform has supported the PingFederate domain for some time. However, the External OAuth Provider has all the features of the PingFederate domain and also includes additional functionality.</p>
<p>Support of the PingFederate domain will be deprecated and removed in the future. We recommend that all PingFederate customers use the External OAuth Provider domain.</p>
<p>An important advantage is that the External OAuth Provider domain supports the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_client_registration_endpoint">Client Registration Endpoint</a>. This allows auto-configuration of apps that have active contracts with APIs that reference the External OAuth Provider domain. Manual configuration of the apps in PingFederate is not necessary.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="why_platform_identity">Should I set up a platform identity, or provide the credentials in the domain configuration?</h2>
<p>Many domains, especially OAuth-related domains, require credentials. When you're setting up your domain, you can set up those credentials as part of the domain definition in the developer portal by entering and/or uploading applicable keys and certificates.</p>
<p>However, as an alternative, you have the option of creating an organization identity in the Policy Manager console, and setting up the security information in Policy Manager. You can then reference the organization identity from the domain setup. With this approach, secure information is not included in the domain configuration.</p>
<p>Keeping all secure information in the identity store, rather than setting up the credentials in the domain definition, is the best option for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Domain configuration is not encrypted in the database, but is encrypted in the identity store.</li>
	<li>Domain configuration is not transported securely from one machine to another within the platform infrastructure.</li>
	<li>The identity store has additional security for storing the private keys, passwords, and shared secrets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In most cases, one Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider or External OAuth Provider domain can support one resource server and one associated platform identity (audience field, certificate, and private key or shared secret). An exception to this is that the External OAuth Provider domain can support multi-valued input in the <strong>audience</strong> field.</p>
<p>If you want to set up a scenario where multiple resource servers can validate the tokens, use the Referenced Bearer option. A key feature of the bearer access token is that validation can be done at the resource server; but only one resource server can be supported. You can support a scenario of multiple resource servers by choosing to have the bearer access token validated at the Authorization Server; however, in this case you lose the key advantage of Bearer access tokens.</p>
<p>If you have multiple resource servers, and choose the same identity for all resource servers, the platform treats it as a single resource server running on multiple machines.</p>
<p>The table below shows which domains support referencing a platform identity, and in what capacity.</p>

<table class="doctable">
<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Domain</th>
		<th>Purpose</th>
		<th>What configuration properties of the identity store are used?</th>
	</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider (Token tab)</td>
		<td> Bearer Access Token signature (always required, since signature is always enabled)</td>
		<td><p>Depending on the signature algorithm selected, either password/shared secret or the Private Key/certificate options are used:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If symmetric signature algorithm is selected, set up shared secret/password in the platform identity.</li>
				<li>If asymmetric signature algorithm is selected, set up private key with certificate in the platform identity.</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider (Token tab)</td>
		<td> Bearer Access Token encryption (Optional: enabled only if encryption is enabled)</td>
		<td>If symmetric encryption algorithm is selected, set up shared secret/password in the platform identity. If asymmetric encryption algorithm is selected, set up <strong>only</strong> X.509 certificate. This is the certificate of the audience of the access token. Obtain the certificate from the entity that is going to validate the access token, and then upload it for this identity.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>OpenID Connect Relying Party Domain (App tab)</td>
		<td>AppID of the relying party application. This domain provides the option to enter the AppID and shared secret within the domain or create a platform identity to represent this AppID.</td>
		<td>It is best to create a platform identity for the OpenID Connect relying party application rather than entering the AppID and shared secret in the domain configuration. If the ID Token involved is using asymmetric encryption, creating a platform identity is the only choice, since the domain's inline configuration only supports shared secret, not private key.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>External OAuth Provider (Access Token Validation tab)</td>
		<td> Access Token signature validation (Tab 4, Access Token Validation)</td>
		<td>This domain supports inline configuration for symmetric signing key or shared secret, and also supports configuring these in a platform identity and referencing the platform identity. Shared secret and password are needed only if symmetric signatures are used: certificate is needed only if asymmetric signatures are used. This is the certificate of the provider that is issuing the access token. Obtain the certificate from the provider and configure it in this domain (either inline or associated with a platform identity).</td>

<h2 id="what_is_jwt">What is JWT?</h2>
<p>A JWT token is a light weight equivalent to SAML for a security token. JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens are based on JSON and are used in new authentication and authorization protocols such as OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0.

There are two kinds of JWT tokens the platform uses in OAuth:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_jwt_token_id">JWT ID token</a>. OpenID Connect 1.0 uses id_token to encode all the user's claims. For example, OpenID Connect could return the id_token with all the user attributes from the LDAP server. JWT ID tokens are signed and optionally encrypted. They are consumed by apps and are signed with either the app's shared secret (known to the app) or the OAuth provider's private key (generally rolling PKI keys published at the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider's JWK Set URL).
	<p>Depending on configuration, the OpenID Connect provider might issue the JWT ID token either from the Authorization Endpoint or the Token Endpoint.</p></li>
	<li><a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_jwt_token_access">JWT Access token</a>. A JWT token that is used as an access token. The JWT Access Token primarily includes the scope of the access token, though it might optionally also include the user's claims. JWT access tokens are issued by the OAuth provider, for consumption by the resource server.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have your credentials, you can set up your Google Connector domain. See <a href="#configure_domain_google">To set up a Google Connector domain in the Akana API Platform</a> below.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: When you're setting up things up in your Google account, remember to enable the Google+ API (Step 3 in the procedure below). If you omit this step, your login won't work.</p>

<h4 id="to_get_credentials_for_a_google_connector_domain">To get credentials for a Google Connector domain:</h4>
<p>Note: the instructions below relate to the Google developer site, which might change over time. Even if the details change, the basic steps will remain the same.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the Google Developers Console at <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/project" title="Google Developers Console" target="_blank">https://console.developers.google.com/project</a> and choose <strong>Create Project</strong>.</li>
	<li>Give your project a name and ID. For the ID, you can accept the suggested ID, click the Refresh icon to get a new suggestion, or choose your own ID. Click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
	<li>The next step is to subscribe to the Google+ API. On the left, click <strong>APIs &amp; Auth</strong> and then click <strong>APIs</strong>. Find the Google+ API on the list, and click the button to enable it. This is the API your app will use to allow users to log in with Google on the platform. Make sure the status for the Google+ API shows as <strong>ON</strong>. If the API status is OFF, your users will see an &quot;Unauthorized&quot; status code when they try to use the Google login.</li>
	<li>Next, get the credentials for your app:
		<ol>
			<li> On the left, click <strong>APIs &amp; Auth</strong> and then click <strong>Credentials</strong>.</li>
			<li>In the <strong>OAuth</strong> section, click <strong>Create New Client ID</strong>. 
			<p><strong>Note</strong>: If credentials already exist for your app, find the correct set of credentials and then find the Client ID and Client Secret for the credentials. Your project might have several sets of credentials; for example, there might be different credentials for a web application, service account, Compute Engine, App Engine, and/or different installed applications such as Android, Chrome, or iOS. Some types of credentials might have a Client ID without a Client Secret. You can create additional credentials as needed.</p></li>
			<li>Make sure Application Type is <strong>Web Application</strong>. </li>
			<li>In the Authorized Redirect URI field, enter the applicable redirect URI. For a login domain, enter: {protocol}://{hostname}/api/login/ssoLogin. For example: https://www.example.com/api.ssoLogin. For other types of domain, refer to the table at <a href="#domain_google_connector_redirect_uri">What value should I use for Redirection URI for my Google Connector domain?</a> below. Google requires that the redirect URL is a public URL.</li>

<h2 id="domain_google_connector_configure">How do I set up a Google Connector domain?</h2>
<p>The Google <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_connectordomain">Connector domain</a> allows users to log in to the platform using Google credentials, and can be used for other activities such as OAuth support. Essentially, the Business Admin registers the platform with Google as a Google app, and then uses the values provided by Google for Google AppID and Google App Shared Secret to set up the Google Connector domain.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Earlier versions of the platform used the OpenID Relying party domain for Google login. It's important to now use Google Connector, which relies on a newer technology recommended and supported by Google; the OpenID Relying party domain uses an older API which Google has scheduled for end of life.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For certain activities, such as creating an API or using the platform API, users must complete the standard platform signup process. Logging in with Google is not adequate for these activities.</p>

	<li>Select <strong>Google Connector</strong> and click <strong>Select</strong>. The <strong>Add Connector Domain</strong> wizard opens at the Details page.</li>
	<li>Specify values for Name and Description and then click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the App Details page of the wizard.</li>
	<li>For <strong>Google Client ID</strong> and <strong>Google Client Secret</strong>, provide the values that were assigned by Google when you registered your instance of the platform as a web application at <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/project" title="Google Developers Console" target="_blank">https://console.developers.google.com/project</a>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the Realm Details page.</li>
	<li>Conditional: if you were using OpenID for Google login in an earlier version of the platform (OpenID Relying Party connector), and want to map values between the old and the new connectors, set up the following:
		<ul>
			<li>To map user accounts to your Google Connector domain, enter the Realm value for your OpenID Connector. It must be a fully qualified URL, including protocol, and must match the value set up on the Client Details page for your OpenID Relying Party domain.</li>
			<li><strong>Use email address of the user to map the user login sessions with existing user accounts using Google domain</strong>: If your Realm values do not match, but you still want to map user login sessions using your existing OpenID Connect domain, click the <strong>Yes</strong> button. *See note below.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you are using the domain for login, you must enable it on the<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Logins</strong> page. See below.</li>

For information on Google login button usage, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/branding-guidelines" target="_blank">Google Sign-In button branding guidelines</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>*<strong>Use email address</strong> field: there is one side effect to using this option. Google allows users to create accounts using a non-Google email address, and to change the email address whenever they want. If a user creates an account on the portal using login with Google, and then changes the email address on Google, and the email mapping option is in place, the portal might interpret the new email address as a new user account. However, since we always give the preference to the OpenID identifier to map the user to the profile, using email mapping will work smoothly in most cases.</p>

<h2 id="h_oauthproviderdomain">Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider Domain:</h2>




<h2 id="oauth_provider_domain_which_type">Which type of OAuth Provider domain should I set up?</h2>
<p>The platform offers two options for setting up an OAuth Provider domain:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider Domain</strong>
		<p>Choose this option if you are using the Akana API platform as your OAuth/OIDC provider. You can set up a separate provider that you want to use for authentication, such as Google or Facebook, and the platform manages the process of authenticating via the separate provider and manages authorization, token issuance, and API access. For more information, see <a href="#domain_oauth_provider_configure">How do I set up and configure an Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain?</a> below.</p></li>
	<li><strong>External OAuth Provider Domain</strong>
	<p>Choose this option if you want to use an entity other than the Akana API platform as your OAuth/OIDC provider; for example, PingFederate or Google. For more information, see <a href="bus_admin_domains_eoap.htm">External OAuth Provider Domain</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="akana_oauth_provider">How do I set up an Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain?</h2>
<p>If you're using Akana as the OAuth Provider, use the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider Domain option. See <a href="#domain_oauth_provider_configure">How do I set up and configure an Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_does_the_authentication_provider_configuration_process_work">How does the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain configuration process work?</h2>
<p>Here's how Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain configuration works:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Administrator installs the feature into the platform container via the <strong>Akana Administration Console</strong>. This process is covered in the installation guide for the platform.</li>
	<li>After the feature is installed, the Business Admin can configure the domain via<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Domains</strong> &gt; <strong>Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider</strong>.</li>
	<li>Once the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain is set up, it is available to the API Admin when configuring the API's OAuth details (<strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Details</strong> &gt; on right, <strong>OAuth Details</strong>). The API Admin chooses the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain and OAuth version, selects one or more grant types, and specifies resources relative to the specified OAuth version. If multiple OAuth Provider domains are defined, the API Admin can choose different OAuth providers for different APIs.</li>
	<li>At runtime, the OAuth Provider manages the OAuth process in the background, directing the app client and the app's user and ensuring authentication and authorization, issuing tokens, and providing API access.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>OAuth Details</strong> function (<strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Details</strong> &gt; on right, <strong>OAuth Details</strong>) includes a pre-defined &quot;third-party provider&quot; domain that allows the API Admin to configure grants and resource mapping for OAuth versions 1.0a and 2.0. No setup is required by the Business Admin for this option. The purpose of this option is so that the API Admin can reference an external OAuth provider, if needed, rather than use one of the OAuth provider configurations provided by the platform implementation.</p>

<p>If you are a Business Admin you can set up one or more OAuth Provider domains by choosing<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Domains</strong>. There are two choices: use the platform as your OAuth/OIDC provider, or set up an external OAuth Provider. For help in determining which one is right for your installation, see <a href="#oauth_provider_domain_which_type">Which type of OAuth Provider domain should I set up?</a></p>
<p>Create a domain for each OAuth Provider scenario you want to support. </p>
<p>API Admins can then choose an OAuth Provider domain in the API OAuth setup page.</p>

<h2 id="domain_oauth_provider_configure">How do I set up and configure an Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain?</h2>
<p>The <strong>Akana OAuth Provider</strong> feature is an add-on. This domain type allows you to use the platform as your OAuth/OIDC provider; you can specify a resource owner authentication domain and configure grant types, access tokens, grant properties, and branding.</p>
<p>Essentially, there are two steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Administrator: In the <strong>Akana Administration Console</strong>, install the <strong>Akana OAuth Provider</strong> feature. This installs the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain option. The Business Admin can then create and configure the domain in the developer portal user interface.</li>
	<li>Business Admin: Set up the domain in the Akana API Platform (see below).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When you install the <strong>Akana OAuth Provider</strong> add-on, it is added to the list of choices in<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Domains</strong> &gt; <strong>Add Domain</strong>. It is not available as a Login option in the<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&nbsp;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Logins</strong> page.</p>


<h4 id="to_configure_domain_oauth_provider">To configure an Akana OAuth/OIDC provider domain:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in as the Business Admin and <a href="bus_admin_overview.htm#admin_menu_busadmin">go to the Admin section</a>.</li>
	<li>On the left menu bar, click <strong>Domains</strong>. The <strong>Domains Summary</strong> page displays.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add Domain</strong> and choose <strong>Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider</strong>. The <strong>Add Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider</strong> wizard opens at the <strong>Details</strong> page. This wizard has seven pages:
<ul>
			<li>1 Details</li>
			<li>2 Grant Types</li>
			<li>3 Token</li>
			<li>4 OpenID Connect</li>
			<li>5 Scopes</li>
			<li>6 Properties</li>
			<li>7 Branding</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	<li>Enter a name and description for your Akana OAuth/OIDC provider (for example, Name=OAuth 2-Legged, Description=OAuth 2-Legged Domain).</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the <strong>Grant Types</strong> page, where you can specify information about one or more <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_oauth_granttypes">OAuth Grant Types</a> that you want the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain to support. Specify values or choose options. For more information, see <a href="#what_are_the_settings_on_the_oauth_provider_grant_types_page">What are the settings on the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider Grant Types page and what options should I choose?</a></li>

Specify values or choose options. For more information, see <a href="#domain_oauth_provider_token_page">What are the settings on the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider Token page and what options should I choose?</a> </li>
 <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the <strong>OpenID Connect</strong> page. Here, you'll set up the necessary values if you want your Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain to use an OpenID Connect Identity Provider for authentication. If not, you can skip this tab. For more information, see <a href="#domain_oauth_provider_oidc_page">What are the settings on the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider OpenID Connect page and what options should I choose?</a></li>
	<li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the <strong>Scopes</strong> page. Here you will define OAuth scopes; later, API Admins for APIs that are using this OAuth domain can map specific operations in the API to these scopes and thus control the functions that OAuth will be requesting access to. For example, you might define a scope called Read-Only and map all GET operations to it. For more information, see <a href="api_admin_oauth_support.htm#how_does_scope_mapping_work">How does Scope Mapping work?</a> Define one or more scopes, with the following values for each:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name</strong>, <strong>short description</strong>, and <strong>full description</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>Default scope</strong> check box: indicates whether this scope is always requested.</li>
			<li><strong>User Authorization Required</strong>: indicates whether user authorization is required for scope access. Usually, it is. However, if an OAuth grant includes all scopes with this option disabled, the provider does not require the resource owner to authorize the grant request.</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the <strong>Properties</strong> page. If you want to set up grant properties, click <strong>+Add</strong> and specify details. For more information, see <a href="#what_is_a_grant_property">What is a Grant Property?</a> For each property, specify the following values:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Property Label</strong>: a text description, used only within the platform.</li>
			<li><strong>Property ID</strong>: the object ID that references the property file.</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the <strong>Branding</strong> page. Here you can customize the page that app users will see when an API that is using this OAuth domain is requesting access to the user's resources. For more information, see <a href="#domain_oauth_provider_branding">What are the settings on the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider Branding page and what options should I choose?</a>	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain is saved, and is now available for selection by API Admins when setting up OAuth details (<strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Details</strong> &gt; on right, <strong>OAuth Details</strong>).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If your implementation will have a load balancer in front of the OAuth Provider container, there is an additional setup step for the Administrator. As well as setting up the OAuth domain, the load balancer settings on your implementation must be set to the below two headers on the outbound request from the load balancer to the platform containers:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>X-Forwarded-Host</strong>: the hostname used to access the load balancer. You could also keep the Host header as is rather than setting this header.</li>
	<li><strong>X-Forwarded-Proto</strong>: the protocol used to access the load balancer; HTTPS if the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_vip">VIP</a> (virtual address for the load balancer) is an HTTPS address, HTTP if the VIP is an HTTP address. You can skip this step if the protocol used from the load balancer to the container is the same as the protocol used from the client to the load balancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>If needed, get help from the Policy Manager Administrator to make sure these settings are correct.</p>

			<td> JWT Bearer Access Token</td>
			<td><p>An access token that uses the  standard and contain all the information the resource server needs to confirm the user&rsquo;s grant to the application, sent as-is in the API request, in the Authorization header. An advantage of the JWT Bearer Access Token is that the Resource Server can validate by itself without having to go back to the Authorization Server. A JWT Bearer Access Token includes more information and can be significantly longer than a referenced bearer token. For more information, see <a href="#should_i_choose_reference_bearer_or_jwt_bearer">Should I choose Referenced Bearer or JWT Bearer Access token?</a> If you choose this option, specify values associated with support of this token type:</p>

					<li><strong>Reference Signing Key from Platform Identity</strong>: Indicates that the signing key is stored in Policy Manager, associated with a platform identity. Enter the platform identity name exactly as it is set up in Policy Manager. For shared secret, setting up a platform identity is optional but recommended. However, if you are using an asymmetric signature algorithm for signing the access token, you must use a platform identity, and make sure the certificate and private key are set up for this identity. For more information, see <a href="#why_platform_identity">Should I set up a platform identity, or provide the credentials in the domain configuration?</a></li>
					<li><strong>Encrypt  JWT Access Token</strong>: Indicates that the JWT Bearer access token should be encrypted. Check the box and specify applicable values. Indicates that the token should be encrypted. If resource owner user information is included in the access token, encryption is important.</li>
					<li><strong>Reference Encryption Key from Platform Identity</strong>: Indicates that the encryption key is stored in Policy Manager, associated with a platform identity. Enter the platform identity name exactly as it is set up in Policy Manager. This identity represents the identity of the application that will be decrypting the access token.

<h2 id="should_i_choose_reference_bearer_or_jwt_bearer">Should I choose Referenced Bearer or JWT Bearer Access token?</h2>
<p>A key advantage of the Bearer token is that the Resource Server can validate the token, without having to go to the Authorization Server. This is more efficient in terms of performance, especially when the Resource Server and OAuth Provider are different vendors.</p>
<p>If you have different vendors for Authorization Server and Resource Server, and want to be able to validate the token at the Resource Server, that is a key reason to choose JWT Bearer Access Token, so there is no need for  a proprietary call to the OAuth Provider. In this scenario, you can write a piece of code to decrypt the message, verify the signature, and then validate.</p>
<p>The Referenced Bearer token is much smaller in size. If header size might be an issue, that would be a reason to choose Referenced Bearer, or at least to support it so that API Admins can choose this option if they want to.</p>
<p>If you want to validate the token at the Authorization Server, you can choose to do that with your access tokens by checking the check box, <strong>Verify JWT Access Token with Authorization Server</strong>. However, by doing so you lose some of the advantage of using an access token and might therefore prefer to go with the smaller Referenced Bearer token.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>




<h2 id="resource_owner_userinfo_in_bearer_token_why">Why choose to include resource owner userinfo in the Bearer Access token?</h2>
<p>When you're setting up the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain, Token tab, and choose the <strong>Bearer Access</strong> token type, you have the option to include resource owner userinfo in the Bearer access token.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Choose yes if</strong>:
		<ul>
			<li>You want the resource owner userinfo to be available either to the resource server or to the downstream service (target endpoint), and do not want to place an additional call to the Authorization Server (see <a href="#should_i_choose_verify_jwt_token_with_auth_server">Should I choose to verify the access token with the Authorization Server?</a>).</li>
			<li>Your network is completely secure and you have no concerns about the userinfo being compromised. In this scenario, it might be acceptable to include userinfo without encryption. However, if there is any possibility that userinfo might be exposed in an insecure environment, encryption is extremely important.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Choose no if</strong>:
		<ul>
			<li>You have concerns about the size of the bearer token. The user information increases the size of the  bearer token, which is already larger than a Referenced Bearer token would be. In addition, if you include the userinfo in the token you should encrypt the information, which further increases the message size.</li>
			<li>It's acceptable in your implementation for the Resource Server to make an additional call to the Authorization Server for the userinfo.</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="what_jwt_signing_algorithms_are_supported">What JWT signing algorithms are supported?</h2>
<p>The platform supports the following algorithms for signing Bearer tokens:</p>
<ul>
	<li>HmacSHA256</li>
	<li>HmacSHA384</li>
	<li>HmacSHA512</li>

<h2 id="should_i_choose_verify_jwt_token_with_auth_server">Should I choose to verify the access token with the Authorization Server?</h2>
<p>As an alternative to including userinfo in the token, you might choose to verify the token with the Authorization Server. When you include userinfo in the  token, a call to the Authorization Server is not needed; however, this approach has drawbacks of its own, including size and the need for encryption (see <a href="#resource_owner_userinfo_in_bearer_token_why">Why choose to include resource owner userinfo in the Bearer Access token?</a>).</p>
<p>If you choose to verify the access token with the Authorization Server, this adds a processing step, but means that you can keep the token size fairly small, without the userinfo and the associated encryption that might be needed to protect it.</p>
<p>In this scenario, you are no longer taking advantage of a key feature of the access token, which is the ability for the Resource Server to validate the token. For this reason, you might consider choosing the Referenced Bearer option instead, which has a more compact token size.</p>
<p>One reason why you might prefer to place a call with the Authorization Server is to ensure any grant revocations are considered when validating the access token. In a scenario where the user has revoked the grant, that information might be at the Authorization Server but not at the Resource Server. For more information, see <a href="#how_manage_grant_revoked_cancelled">How does the platform manage validation of the JWT access tokens in the resource server when the grant is revoked or cancelled?</a></p>
<p>There are advantages to either approach; which decision is best depends on your unique scenario.</p>

If the app developer wants the scope information returned, he/she can include the <strong>scope</strong> parameter as part of the authorization request (<strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Details</strong> &gt; on right, <strong>OAuth Details</strong>).</li>

<h2 id="what_is_a_grant_property">What is a Grant Property?</h2>
<p>Grant Properties are custom values that you can define at the domain level to support collecting information from resource owners (end users) that could be used in the context of giving the app access to the user's resources.</p>
<p>Grant properties are not exposed to apps. They can be used to enhance the user experience when an app invokes the API using the grant.</p>
<p>Examples of grant properties might be: &quot;Notify me when the app uses this grant,&quot; or &quot;Only allow withdrawals up to $500.&quot;</p>
<p>Downstream from the domain, grant properties allow  the API to configure how an app will use the API access permissions that are granted to it. For example, in a banking app, grant properties could be used to allow access to transaction details or current balance, but not allow a withdrawal.</p>
<p>Grant properties are set up in the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain, <strong>Tab 6, Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>At runtime, the end-user authenticates with the API and then sees the app authorization page. Typically, if there are grant properties, this page will include fields where the end-user can authorize specific access options to the app.</p>
<p>Based on the user's specific authorization, an access token is sent to the app, allowing access to the user's resources that are accessible via the API, as authorized by the user. Any limitations determined by the grant properties are part of the access token.</p>
<p>The app can then use this token to start sending requests. The grant properties are sent back to the client application for validation.</p>
<p><strong>Example (money transfer API):</strong></p>
<p>If the API being secured is a money transfer API, the resource owner might want a restriction to limit the maximum value of a transaction to $100, with a maximum of only one transaction per month (for example, magazine subscription application).</p>
<ul>
	<li>To support this, the OAuth provider could define a &quot;Maximum transaction amount&quot; property and a &ldquo;Maximum number of transactions&quot; per month property in the application, and specify the Property ID (tag) for each of these in the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain definition on Tab 6, <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
	<li>As part of the OAuth approval process, the end-user first authenticates with the identity provider. The user then sees the Authorization page for authorization of  the client app to access the user's resources protected by the API. The grant property labels are displayed with text entry fields. The user enters the values for the grant properties and clicks <strong>Authorize</strong>.</li>
	<li>The app is granted the requested permissions, but the specific limitations specified by the end-user are applied to the app's permission to limit the app's access to the user's resources.</li>

<h2 id="domain_oauth_provider_support_sso_login">How can I set up my Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain to support end-user login from an external identity provider?</h2>
<p>You can set up an Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain to support SSO with an external identity provider with these two types of identity provider:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An identity provider that only has APIs rather than offering a user interface for login&#8212;such as LDAP or CA SiteMinder</li>
	<li>An identity provider that provides a login application&#8212;such as OpenID Connect or SAML Web SSO Identity Provider. In this scenario, the platform can redirect the user to the login application and then have the login application redirect the user back to the OAuth Provider after authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using this approach, depending on where your end-user identities are, you can configure different domains and use the appropriate domain as the resource owner authentication domain in the OAuth Provider configuration (Grant Types tab). For example, you would configure an <a href="bus_admin_domains_oidc.htm#domain_openid_connect_relying_party_config">OpenID Connect Relying Party domain</a>, <a href="#domains_login_setup_saml_web_sso">SAML Web SSO domain</a>, or <a href="#domain_ldap_configure">LDAP</a> or <a href="#domains_login_setup_ca_siteminder">CA SiteMinder</a> domain.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="auth_server_url_define">What is an Authorization Server URL?</h2>
<p>As part of setting up the OAuth Provider domain to use the platform as an OAuth provider, the Business Admin must specify the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_oauth_authorizationserverurl">Authorization Server URL</a> for the platform. This is the URL for the server designated by the OAuth provider to perform the authorization steps to a) authenticate the resource owner (or to delegate the authentication process to a trusted identity provider), and b) get the resource owner's permission for the app to access the resources. The app directs the resource owner (user) to the Authorization Server URL; when the authorization steps are complete, the Authorization Server returns the user to the app, using the redirect URL provided by the app.</p>
<p>The Authorization Server URL is  the URL at which the OAuth Provider accesses the requests, for both <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_oauth_authorizationendpoint">Authorization Endpoint</a> and <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_oauth_tokenendpoint">Token Endpoint</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: One deployment can support more than one OAuth Provider. If there is more than one, it is important that each OAuth Provider has a different Authorization Server URL, for both <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_oauth_authorizationendpoint">Authorization Endpoint</a> and <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_oauth_tokenendpoint">Token Endpoint</a>.</p>
<p>When setting up an Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain on the platform, once you have specified the Authorization Server URL it is important to make sure that requests are directed to this URL where the Akana OAuth Provider feature is installed. This might include additional actions; for example, adding a DNS entry or configuring the load balancer if the URL is a virtual endpoint on F5. If you are setting up an External OAuth Provider domain, this is not necessary.</p>
<p>The URL you provide for the Authorization Server is the base of the URL for the Request Token URL, Access Token URL, and Authorize URL, with additional parts of the paths as shown below. The <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_oauth_callbackurl">Callback URL</a> is the Redirect URL that an app developer would provide in the App details page.</p>
<p>For specific Authorization Server URLs for the platform, see <a href="#auth_server_url_platform">What is the OAuth Authorization Server URL for the platform?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="auth_server_url_platform">What is the OAuth Authorization Server URL for the platform?</h2>
<p>When you are setting up an Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain on the platform, the URL you provide for the Authorization Server (OAuth endpoint) is the base of the URL for the Request Token URL, Access Token URL, and Authorize URL, with additional parts of the paths as shown below.</p>
<p>When setting up the OAuth Authorization Server URL in the platform, enter only the base of the URL, including protocol, host, and port if needed. The platform appends the appropriate path as listed below after the {oauth.provider.url} variable.</p>
<p>For example, let's say the Authorization Server URL you specify in the provider configuration is:</p>
<pre>https://www.acmepaymentscorp.com:9800</pre>
<p>Use that value in place of the {oauth.provider.url} placeholder. The platform appends the rest of the URL in each case.</p>
<p>For OAuth 2.0, the OAuth Authorization Endpoint URL becomes:</p>
<pre>https://www.acmepaymentscorp.com:9800/oauth/auz/authorize</pre>
<p>OAuth Token Endpoint URL becomes:</p>
<pre>https://www.acmepaymentscorp.com:9800/oauth/oauth20/token</pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: App developers need to know the Authorization Server URL in order to set up their apps to use the OAuth domain. This information must be made available to API Admins, who must make sure it is included in API documentation.</p>
<p>For general information on Authorization Server URLs, see <a href="#auth_server_url_define">What is an Authorization Server URL?</a> above.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are setting up an External OAuth Provider domain, you'll need to provide the Authorization Server URL of your provider. Generally, this is available at the well-known configuration endpoint. See <a href="bus_admin_domains_eoap.htm#why_choose_eoap">When would I choose an External OAuth Provider domain?</a></p>

<h2 id="what_are_the_oauth_custom_headers">What are the OAuth custom headers?</h2>
<p>When an API uses the platform as a proxy, in the API setup the API is the Target API and the platform is the Proxy API.</p>
<p>When an app sends a request, if the API is using the platform as a proxy API and is using the OAuth policy, the platform adds custom headers in the outbound request from the proxy API. These custom headers include key information necessary for the transaction, such as resource owner identity and grant properties.</p>
<p>For more detailed information about these headers, refer to <a href="api_admin_oauth_support.htm#how_does_proxy_api_send_oauth_headers">How does the proxy API send OAuth-related information to my API?</a> (API Admin documentation).</p>

<h2 id="what_is_a_jwt_bearer_assertion">What is a Bearer Assertion, and what does the platform support for Bearer Assertions?</h2>
<p>The platform supports the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_jwt_token"> Token</a>, or Bearer Assertion, which is an <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_oauth_extensiongranttype">extension grant type</a> that is generally used when the app already has an Assertion that represents the resource owner. The app sends the  Assertion to the Authorization Server&rsquo;s <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_oauth_tokenendpoint">Token Endpoint</a> to get an access token for later use.</p>
<p>The Bearer Assertion is generally issued by an <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_identityprovider">Identity Provider</a> and consumed by a <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_relyingparty">Relying Party</a> that relies on its content to identify the subject&#8212;that is, the user being authenticated.</p>
<p>The platform supports Bearer Assertions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Issued by the platform</strong>. To use Bearer Assertions issued by the platform, they must be issued by the same OAuth Provider. If there are multiple Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domains, you cannot use Bearer Assertions issued by a different platform OAuth Provider. It <strong>must</strong> be the same OAuth Provider producing and consuming the Bearer Assertion.</li>
	<li><strong>Issued by a different provider</strong>. To use Bearer Assertions issued by a different provider, the Resource Owner authentication domain must be an OpenID Connect Relying Party domain. The Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain can use the Bearer Assertions issued by the external OpenID Connect Provider.</li></ul>
<p>In the context of the platform, when the  token is used as an access token, all the information needed for the access token is already part of the token. This is efficient in terms of processing.</p>
<p>This grant type supports <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_oauth_refreshtoken">refresh tokens</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>




<h2 id="what_token_types_should_i_support">What token types should I support?</h2>
<p>When setting up your Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain, on the <strong>Token</strong> tab, there are three key choices for tokens: </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bearer</strong>: Two types of bearer tokens (bearer tokens are sent as-is in the API request, in the Authorization header):
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Referenced Bearer</strong></li>
			<li><strong>JWT Bearer Access Token</strong></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>MAC</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Below is some information about the different types of access tokens, to help you decide which one to choose, or whether you should support more than one option.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using an External OAuth Provider domain, the available possibilities depend on the token types your provider supports</p>
<h4>Referenced Bearer</h4>
<p>A short random token that uniquely identifies the grant, sent as-is in the API request, in the Authorization header. If you enable this token type, you can specify the length of the bearer access token that will be generated. A longer token is stronger. Default: 40. </p>
<p>Referenced Bearer tokens and JWT bearer access tokens are similar, but validating a Referenced Bearer token requires a round trip to the OAuth provider to validate the bearer token and to obtain the scope and the user's claims.
</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="#should_i_choose_reference_bearer_or_jwt_bearer">Should I choose Referenced Bearer or JWT Bearer Access token?</a></p>
<h4> JWT Bearer Access Token</h4>
<p>An access token that uses the  standard and contain all the information the resource server needs to confirm the user&rsquo;s grant to the application, sent as-is in the API request, in the Authorization header. An advantage of the Bearer access token is that the Resource Server can validate by itself without having to go back to the Authorization Server.</p>
<p>This token type provides the fastest option for security. However, a Bearer token includes more information and can be significantly longer than a Referenced Bearer token. In addition, it does not include protection against a replay attack (the nonce in the MAC token), and there is no specification governing how to check whether a specific access token has been revoked. </p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="#should_i_choose_reference_bearer_or_jwt_bearer">Should I choose Referenced Bearer or JWT Bearer Access token?</a></p>
<h4>MAC</h4>
<p>A MAC token includes a digital signature and a <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_nonce">nonce</a>, and is more secure than a bearer token. Use of a MAC token by a client is more complex than using a Bearer token; however, the MAC token offers non-repudiation and message replay attack prevention options to the API requests.</p>
<h4>Supporting multiple token types</h4>
<p>Supporting multiple token types requires a more complex implementation but offers users more options.</p>
<p>When you specify more than one token type, you can specify a default. You can also choose whether or not to allow users to override the default.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_does_token_encryption_work">How does token encryption work?</h2>
<p>In general, most OAuth messages include some level of encryption, for security purposes.</p>
<p>Symmetric is a lower level of security, implemented in the platform with the app Shared Secret. Asymmetric is a higher level of security, implemented with a public/private key pair and certificate. Within those two divisions there are different levels of security according to factors such as the specific algorithm used and the length of the token.</p>
<p>Normally, encryption is a two-step process as covered below.</p>
<h4>Encryption process</h4>
<ol>
	<li>  The entire message is encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm.</li>
	<li>  For extra security, the second step is encryption of the random symmetric message key. There are three possible levels:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Maximum security</strong>: encryption of the message key with an asymmetric encryption algorithm.</li>
			<li><strong>Less secure but still very secure</strong>: encryption of the message key with a symmetric encryption algorithm (either the same one, or a different one).</li>
			<li><strong>Least security</strong>: no encryption of the key.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
</ol>
<h4>Decryption process</h4>
<p>Decrypting the message is an exact reversal of the encryption process:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Decryption of the message key (assuming it was encrypted).</li>
	<li>Decryption of the entire message using the decrypted message key.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_manage_grant_revoked_cancelled">How does the platform manage validation of the JWT access tokens in the resource server when the grant is revoked or cancelled?</h2>
<p>By default, JWT access tokens are always validated at the gateway (Network Director). The gateway periodically downloads all revoked and cancelled grants that have unexpired access tokens, and keeps this information in local memory, to be used while processing a JWT token. It can then reject JWT access tokens for grants that have been revoked or cancelled.</p>
<p>This is also true of other token types such as Referenced Bearer or MAC tokens.</p>
<p>Initially, the grant corresponding to the token is stored in local memory at the resource server, for faster processing. If a grant is modified (via workflow, revocation, or any other means), the modified grant is updated in the local memory asynchronously, via the scheduled job, which runs at an interval of 1 minute. Until that time, requests continue to be successful.</p>
<p>A possible drawback to this approach is that the JWT access token continues to be successful at the gateway until the scheduled job updates the local cache with cancelled/revoked grant information. This could mean that JWT access tokens for revoked grants could be accepted for a short period of time before they start to be rejected. The scheduled job runs at an interval of 1 minute.</p>
<p>This scenario is similar to browsers downloading the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) from the certificate authorities (CAs).</p>
<!--<p>{ATMO-15734 1/26/16}If the resource server finds the token to be invalid, processing continues as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>For JWT tokens</strong>: If the check box to verify the grant with the Authorization Server is not checked, since all the grant information is in the token claims, the grant is processed from that information.</li>
	<li><strong>For token types other than JWT</strong>: since the grant is not in local memory, the Gateway goes to the Authorization Server for grant information.</li>
</ul>-->
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Business Admin can configure the Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider domain to have the gateway verify JWT Access Tokens with the Authorization Server as well (Akana OAuth/OIDC Provider Domain, Tab 3, Token: <strong>Verify JWT Access Token with Authorization Server</strong>). In this scenario, validation is similar to that of the Referenced Bearer token. However, with this approach you lose a key feature of the JWT Access Token, the ability for the Resource Server to validate the token.</p>

<h2 id="h_pingfederatedomain">PingFederate Domain:</h2>




<h2 id="pf_supported_versions">What versions of PingFederate does the platform support?</h2>
<p>The platform supports the following versions of <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_pingfederate">PingFederate</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>7.1.3x</li>
	<li>7.3.x to 8.3.x</li>
	<li>9.x (8.4.18 and later)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_do_i_configure_eoap_pf">How do I configure an External OAuth Provider domain for PingFederate?</h2>
<p>To get everything configured correctly, you must perform some setup steps in PingFederate and Policy Manager before going ahead with the Akana API Platform setup. Follow the procedures listed below, in sequence:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#pf_config_1_pf_eoap">PingFederate Configuration</a></li>
	<li><a href="#pf_config_2_pm_eoap">Policy Manager Configuration</a></li>
	<li><a href="#pf_config_3_cm_eoap">Akana API Platform Configuration</a></li>
</ol>


<h3 id="pf_config_1_pf_eoap">1: PingFederate Configuration</h3>
<p>You must have a working PingFederate installation.</p>
<p>In your PingFederate server configuration, do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In Server Configuration &gt; System Settings &gt; Server Settings, in the Federation Info section, make sure the base URL value is defined and is accessible from the Akana API Platform.
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: you will use this value in the Akana API Platform later on, in the PingFederate domain setup, on the <strong>Provider Details</strong> page.</p></li>
	<li>Validate and export the server certificate: In Server Configuration &gt; Security &gt; SSL Server Certificates, make sure there is a valid, activated certificate defined. The PingFederate server certificate must have a &quot;Common Name&quot; matching the hostname in the base URL. If necessary, create a new certificate. When you know the certificate is valid, click the Export link to export the certificate.</li>
	</ul>
<p>In PingFederate, create a client (application) to represent the Akana API Platform. You must set up the client as a resource server in your PingFederate instance so that the Akana API Platform can communicate with PingFederate. Follow the instructions below.</p>
<h4>To create the Akana API Platform client in PingFederate</h4>
<ol>
	<li>In PingFederate, click OAuth Settings &gt; Client Management, and choose <strong>Add Client</strong>.</li>
	<li>For <strong>Client Authentication</strong>, choose <strong>Client Secret</strong>.</li>
	<li>Configure the client with the following settings:
		<ul>
			<li>Client ID: enter a unique ID for your Akana API Platform client. This is the equivalent of a login. For example, <strong>PingFederate</strong>.</li>
			<li>Client Secret: click Generate Secret and copy the secret so that you can set up the same value in the Akana API Platform in a later step.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Choose a name.</li>
	<li>Under <strong>Allowed Grant Types</strong>, choose <strong>Access Token Validation (Client is a Resource Server)</strong>.</li>
	<li>Save your settings.</li>
</ol>
<p>In PingFederate, set up the password credential validator. This validates the credentials provided through the OAuth user interface when a token is requested. See below.</p>

<h4>To set up password credential validation in PingFederate</h4>
<ol>
	<li>In PingFederate, in the settings for your Akana API Platform client, click Authentication &gt; Password Credential Validators.</li>
	<li>Choose <strong>Create New Instance</strong>.</li>
	<li>Specify Instance Name, Instance ID, and Type, and save the values.</li>
	</ol>
<p>That completes the initial PingFederate setup. The next step is to set up the PingFederate credentials in Policy Manager so that PingFederate is trusted.</p>

<h3 id="pf_config_2_pm_eoap">2: Policy Manager Configuration (HTTPS only)</h3>
<p>In Policy Manager, depending on the exact scenario, you might need to complete either or both of these steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Set up the PingFederate server certificate in Policy Manager</strong>: if your PingFederate implementation is expecting HTTPS connections, you must set up the PingFederate server certificate. Follow the steps below.</li>
	<li><strong>Set up a platform identity in Policy Manager for the PingFederate domain</strong>: see <a href="#proc_pm_identity_set_up">To set up a platform identity in Policy Manager for a domain in the developer portal</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: It's important to complete any steps in Policy Manager <strong>before</strong> setting up the domain in the Akana API Platform.</p>
<h4 id="p_https_cert_setup_pf">To set up the PingFederate server certificate in Policy Manager</h4>
<p>This step is needed if your PingFederate implementation is expecting HTTPS connections.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Add the issuer of the PingFederate server certificate in the platform trust store. In Policy Manager: <strong>Console</strong> &gt; <strong>Configure</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Certificates</strong> &gt; <strong>Trusted CA Certificates</strong> tab. This step is needed so that the Akana API Platform will trust the PingFederate Authorization Server endpoints. Note that when you upload the certificate, it generally takes a couple of minutes to take effect. Allow some time after uploading the certificates before setting up the domain in the Akana API Platform.</li>
	<li>For more information about setting up CA certificates in Policy Manager, see <a href="../../ag/security_config/trusted_ca_certificates.html">Trusted CA Certificates</a> (Policy Manager help).</li>
	<li><strong>Required only if you uploaded the CA certificate after configuring the domain</strong>: After waiting for five minutes for the trusted CA certificate information to get refreshed, update the PingFederate domain (even though there were no changes). This triggers each of the containers to re-initialize the provider with the new trusted CA certificates. Alternatively, you can restart each of the containers where the API platform is installed.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="pf_config_3_cm_eoap">3: Akana API Platform Configuration</h3>
<p>When the PingFederate setup steps and Policy Manager setup steps are done, it's time to set up the PingFederate domain in the Akana API Platform.</p>
<h4 id="configure_domain_eoap_pf">To set up an External OAuth Provider domain in the Akana API Platform for PingFederate</h4>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: Instructions for setting up an External OAuth Provider domain are provided in <a href="bus_admin_domains_eoap.htm#domain_add_eoap">How do I add an External OAuth Provider domain?</a> Specifically for PingFederate, there are two sections that include additional information, specifically for PingFederate, when you choose PingFederate as the provider and read in the configuration information. The additional information is on Tab 4, Access Token Validation, in the right column, and on Tab 5, Extensions.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Log in as the Business Admin and <a href="bus_admin_overview.htm#admin_menu_busadmin">go to the Admin section</a>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Domains</strong>. The <strong>Domains Summary</strong> page displays.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add Domain</strong>. The <strong>Select Domain Type</strong> drop-down menu displays.</li>
	<li>Select <strong>External OAuth  Provider</strong> and then click <strong>Select</strong>. The <strong>Add Connector Domain</strong> wizard opens.</li>
	<li><strong>Details</strong> page: Specify values for Name and Description and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Configure</strong> page: For Provider Type, choose <strong>PingFederate</strong>. Choose to provide the well-known configuration URL, paste the configuration JSON, or set up manually. If you read or paste the information, all the PingFederate values are read in automatically. Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Provider</strong> page: Review the values that were read in from the configuration, and adjust as needed. Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Access Token Validation</strong> page: Review the values that were read in from the configuration, and adjust as needed. For information on the specific values relating to PingFederate, see <a href="bus_admin_domains_eoap.htm#settings_eoap_token_validation_pf">What are the settings on the External OAuth Provider Access Token Validation page for PingFederate?</a> Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Extensions</strong> page: the PingFederate extension information is displayed. For more information, see <a href="bus_admin_domains_eoap.htm#settings_eoap_extensions_pf">What are the settings on the External OAuth Provider Extensions page for PingFederate, and what options should I choose?</a> Review the values and adjust as needed.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above steps complete the setup of the PingFederate domain. Once these steps are complete, authorized platform users can create APIs that use the PingFederate domain, and business admins or app developers can create apps that subscribe to those APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: With the older PingFederate connector domain, for each app using an API that uses PingFederate as an OAuth provider, the PingFederate Admin had to set up the app as a PingFederate client so that the app can be authenticated. With the External OAuth Provider domain, this activity is automated.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="pf_domain_configure">How do I configure a PingFederate Connector domain?</h2>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: We recommend that PingFederate users choose the External OAuth Provider domain rather than the legacy PingFederate domain. See <a href="bus_admin_domains_eoap.htm">External OAuth Provider Domain</a>. PingFederate configuration is still required, as covered in <a href="bus_admin_ov_pf_endtoend.htm">PingFederate Usage Scenario: End to End</a>.</p>
<p>The PingFederate&reg; <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_connectordomain">Connector domain</a> allows you to use <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_pingfederate">PingFederate</a> as an OAuth provider. Essentially, the Business Admin registers the platform with PingFederate as the resource server, and then uses the values provided by PingFederate to set up the PingFederate Provider domain in the Akana API Platform.</p>

</ol>


<h3 id="pf_config_1_pf_pfc">1: PingFederate Configuration</h3>
<p>You must have a working PingFederate installation, including installation of the <strong>Akana PingFederate Integration Add-on Feature</strong> (Plug-In). The Administrator must install the PingFederate plug-in on the following containers:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Network Director</strong>: All Network Director containers</li>
	<li><strong>Community Manager</strong>: All containers that have the OAuth Provider and CM APIs features installed.</li>
	<li><strong>Policy Manager for DataPower</strong>: In a PMDP scenario, for a standalone configuration, the feature must be installed on the container. If there is a master/slave configuration, the features must be installed on both the master and the slave.</li>
