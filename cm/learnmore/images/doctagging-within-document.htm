<h4>Tagging within a document</h4>
<p>This document offers an example of how you could set up your own test file to set up your own unique scenarios and test user, group, scope, and license combinations that might be applicable to your installation.</p>
<p>Note: A full set of linked files and setup instructions is available as a ZIP file that you can customize, upload, and test. To get a copy of the doc tagging ZIP file, contact Technical Support.</p>
<hr/>



<h5>Setup steps</h5>
<p>The sections below use different types of doc tagging. In each section, the title and explanatory text is visible to all; then there is a line of tagged text that will be visible only to authorized users. You can use this to test whether your visibility settings are set up correctly.</p>
<p>To test visibility you'll have to set up the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users: 
    <ul>
      <li>Registered user</li>
      <li>Site Admin</li>
      <li>Business Admin</li>
      <li>API Admin</li>
      <li>User who is both Site Admin and Business Admin</li>
      <li>User who is both API Admin and Business Admin</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Groups:
   <ul>
      <li>public-private-group-1</li>
      <li>private-group-2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scopes: 
    <ul>
      <li>Public: public-scope-1, public-scope-2</li>
      <li>Private: private-scope-1, private-scope-2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>License: 
    <ul>
      <li>Public: public-license-1</li>
      <li>Private: private-license-1</li>
      <li>public-private-license-1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Tagging by role: Text visible only to user who is both Site Admin and Business Admin</h5>
<p>The link below will be visible only to users who are <strong>both</strong> Site Admin and Business Admin.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When tagging by role, if multiple roles are referenced in the tag, by default a user with just one of the roles can see the content.

<p><strong>Note</strong>: When tagging by scope, if multiple scopes are referenced in the tag, the user must have visibility of <strong>both</strong> scopes in order to see the content. In all other types of dynamic tags, if multiple scopes are referenced, users must have visibility of just one of the scopes in order to see the content.</p>

<soa:showforscope scopeNames="public-scope-1, private-scope-1">
