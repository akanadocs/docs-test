<h1 id="top">Simple Developer Theme</h1>
<p>Simple Developer theme  is a simplified user interface supporting all functions needed by App developers and most functions needed by API Admins. API documentation must be uploaded by the Site Admin in <a href="basics_theme_hermosa_201910.htm">Hermosa Theme</a>.</p>
<p>Simple Developer theme doesn't expose APIs. In general, Simple Developer theme is most used in a scenario where there is only one API, and the connections are maintained directly using the auto-connect feature.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In version 2020.1.0 and later, there is another theme, <a href="basics_theme_bonita.htm">Bonita</a>, which has a streamlined user interface which is quite similar to Simple Developer theme but also provides read-only access to API information.</p>
