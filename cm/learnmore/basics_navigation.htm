<a name="what_is_the_dashboard"></a><h3>What is the Dashboard?</h3>
<p>The <em>Dashboard</em> is a configurable information system that is used to view and manage event notifications relating to activity that occurs on your platform account.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When you log into the platform, the first page that displays is your personal <em>Dashboard</em> page.</li>
  <li>Here you can view all notifications relating to your activity on the platform such as apps, APIs, or groups you're involved with.</li>
  <li>You can also view an aggregation of all relevant activity since your last login. Your <em>Dashboard</em> collects all discussions, comments, trouble tickets, requests, and invitations associated with your application projects and the APIs you choose to follow. Think of this as your &ldquo;newsfeed.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>You can configure your email notifications on the <em>User Settings</em> page.</li>
</ul>
<p> For more information on notifications and newsfeed functionality, see <a href="basics_account_management.htm#how_do_i_enable_or_disable_email_notifications">How do I enable or disable email notifications</a>, <a href="basics_account_management.htm#how_do_notifications_work">How do notifications work?</a>, and <a href="app_stay_informed.htm#what_information_is_displayed_on_my_dashboard">What information is displayed on my Dashboard?</a></p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_are_the_components_of_the_apis_section"></a><h3>What are the components of the APIs section?</h3>
<p>The APIs interface provides functionality that allows developers to view available APIs and configuration details, view and download API documentation. New or potential members can review existing APIs and read the documentation to determine which APIs include functionality that can be included in an app.</p>
<p> The APIs section is organized into the following functional areas:</p>

<p><strong> API Details</strong></p>
<p> When an API Name is selected, the <em>Details</em> page displays and presents feature overview documentation for the selected API. You can also select different API versions using the Version menu. The endpoints available for the API are presented (i.e., Sandbox, Production). Each API includes Peer Reviews that you can view, as well as a Similar APIs section which provides a listing of other APIs that include similar functionality.</p>

<p><strong>API Board</strong></p>
<p>The <em>API Board</em> is a collaboration tool that includes both a <em>discussion</em> board and a <em>ticket</em> management system. API Administrators / Developers / Team Members with access privileges to APIs or Apps can collaborate by posting discussion topics, can raise issues for a specific API or App by creating a ticket, or can post alerts (for example, API news or maintenance announcements). You can manage the display of API activity posted to the <em>Dashboard</em> newsfeed using the <strong>Follow</strong> / <strong>Unfollow</strong> functions.</p>

<p><strong>Monitor</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Monitor</em> page provides API performance and health monitoring information (traffic, events, alerts comments, tickets, and so forth) for the API Admin. Chart presentations include Chart and Usage Log views.</p>

<p><strong> Documents</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Documentation</em> page displays the reference documentation for the current API. Each API includes an API Overview and topics for each API Method. A typical organization might include Uses Cases, URI, Syntax, Sample Request, Request Parameters, Response Parameters, Sample Response, Error Codes, and Related Topics sections. API Providers can utilize the <em>File Manager</em> to upload and manage documentation. See <a href="api_admin_content_guidelines.htm">Content Development Guidelines</a> for details.</p>

<p><strong>Legal</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Legal</em> page provides a listing of legal agreements associated with the current API. These agreements typically pertain to API usage requirements, limitations, liability, and service level expectations. The API Provider is responsible for providing and enforcing legal agreements. All users that have visibility rights to an API can view the legal agreements. API Providers can upload and manage the legal agreements using the <em>File Manager</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Visibility</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Visibility</em> option gives access to the Groups page, which provides a method of creating common interest groups around APIs that are defined with private visibility, and also allows the API Admin to invite independent groups on the platform to have visibility into the API. If the API is private, a platform user can only see it if he/she is a member of a group that has visibility. Group accounts are created, and member invitations are sent and managed by the API Provider or assigned API Administrator. Only API Administrators can create Private API Groups or invite independent groups to have visibility into the API.</p>

<p><strong>Admins</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Admins</em> page provides functionality that allows API Providers to send out invitations to individuals to whom they would like to grant administration privileges for their API. API administrators can then be viewed and managed in a summary listing.</p>

<p><strong>Apps</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Apps</em> page allows API Providers and designated API Administrators to manage approval of access requests for their API.</p>

<p><strong>Followers</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Followers</em> page provides a list of members that are currently following the activity of the selected API.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_are_the_components_of_the_groups_section"></a><h3>What are the components of the Groups section?</h3>
<p>When you click the Groups icon in the top navigation bar, it takes you to the My Groups page. From there, you can click through for details of any group you are a member of.</p>
<p>When you click through to an individual group, the left menu gives you access to the following functional areas:</p>
<p><strong>Group Details</strong></p>
<p>The Details page for the selected group. This provides a visual overview of information about the group, including when it was created, tags, number of members and administrators, and ratings and reviews. If you are a group administrator you can edit the group definition.</p>

<p><strong>Group Board</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Group Board</em> is a collaboration tool that provides access to discussions relating to the group.</p>
<p><strong>Members</strong></p>
<p>The Members page provides a visual summary of members, including their status. If you are an Administrator for the group you can invite additional members and can change the role of existing members or remove members from the group.</p>

<p><strong>Admins</strong></p>
<p>The Admins page provides a visual summary of group administrators. If you are an Administrator for the group you can invite additional users to be Administrators. You can also change the status of an existing Administrator to be a group Member or Leader.</p>
<p><strong>Followers</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Followers</em> page provides a list of members that are currently following the activity of the selected group.</p>



<a name="how_do_i_search_for_information"></a><h3>How do I search for information?</h3>
