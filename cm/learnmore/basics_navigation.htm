<h2 id="platform_ui_overview">Platform user interface &quot;theme&quot;</h2>
<p>When you access the Community Manager developer portal, whether or not you've signed in, the look and feel of the user interface, as well as its structure and capabilities, are determined by choices and settings made by the Administrator.</p>
<p>There are two main factors that affect the look and feel of the Community Manager developer portal:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Theme</strong>
<p>The theme determines the layout of user interface capabilities and, in some cases, whether certain capabilities are available in the user interface or not. For examples, see below.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Customization</strong>
<p>Customization determines aspects of the user interface such as font style, weight, and color, logo, icons, and background color.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>One of the key elements that the theme controls is the layout of the user interface. Regardless of customization, which primarily affects factors such as colors and fonts, the general layout is determined by the theme.</p>
<p>The general layout affects navigation, which in turn affects procedures in the help documentation.</p>
<p>For an overview of the general layout, in a sample user interface, click the link:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="basics_theme_bonita.htm">Bonita Theme</a> (Version 2020.1.0 and later)</li>
	<li><a href="basics_theme_default.htm">Default Theme (versions prior to 2020.2.0)</a> </li>
	<li><a href="basics_theme_hermosa.htm">Hermosa Theme (Versions up to 2019.1.0)</a></li>
	<li><a href="basics_theme_hermosa_201910.htm">Hermosa Theme (2019.1.0 and later)</a></li>
	<li><a href="basics_theme_simpledev.htm">Simple Dev Theme</a>
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: Simple Dev theme is deprecated in version 2020.2.0, and will be removed in a future release.</p></li>
	<li><a href="basics_theme_devops.htm">Dev Ops Theme</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: These examples are very general, only intended to illustrate layout. There are other customizable factors determining the look and feel of the Community Manager developer portal.</p>

<h2 id="action_dashboard_define">What is the Action Dashboard?</h2>
<p>The Action Dashboard is a configurable information system that helps users stay informed about relevant activity in the Community Manager developer portal. Each user's Action Dashboard is an aggregate of notifications and other information relating to all the boards that the user is following, including boards for apps, APIs, and groups.</p>
<p>For more information on the Action Dashboard, see <a href="basics_actiondashboard.htm">Action Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>For more information on notifications, see:</p>

<h2 id="basics_apps_see">Where can I see my apps, APIs, and groups?</h2>
<p>Once you've created one or more apps, APIs, or groups, you can view the list and work with your resources.</p>

<h2 id="navigation_my_apis">What are the components of the APIs section?</h2>
<p>The APIs interface provides functionality that allows developers to view available APIs and configuration details, view and download API documentation. New or potential members can review existing APIs and read the documentation to determine which APIs include functionality that can be included in an app.</p>
<p>The APIs section is organized into the following functional areas:</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>When an API Name is selected, the <strong>Overview</strong> page displays, with a summary of information about the API and access to various functions such as requesting a contract with the API. For details, see <a href="apiadmin_overview.htm#apiadmin_pages_overview">What information is available on the API Overview page?</a></p>
<p><strong>Reviews</strong>: You can write a review about an API you're connected to. Depending on the platform settings, reviews might be published immediately or might need to be approved by a moderator. If you have written a review and want to revise it later, you can do that. If reviews are moderated, the earlier review remains published until the revision is published, at which point the earlier review is deleted. If you revise a review, the marks count resets to 0 for the revised review.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
<p>Provides a summary view of the API design and access to the API Designer.</p>

<p><strong>Implementations</strong></p>
<p>Provides a summary view of valid implementations for the API, <strong>Add</strong> button, and <strong>Edit</strong> link so that you can manage implementations. See <a href="apiadmin_implementations.htm">Managing API Implementations</a>. You can also view the API description in different format; see <a href="apiadmin_a_d_d_support.htm#supported_languages_view">How can I view the API description document for an API?</a></p>

<p><strong>Forum</strong></p>
<p>The API <strong>Forum</strong> is a collaboration tool that includes both a discussion forum and a ticket management system. API Administrators / Developers / Team Members with access privileges to APIs or Apps can collaborate by posting discussion topics, can raise issues for a specific API or App by creating a ticket, or can post alerts (for example, API news or maintenance announcements). You can manage the display of API activity posted to the <strong>Action Dashboard</strong> using the <strong>Follow</strong> / <strong>Unfollow</strong> functions. For general information about forums on the Community Manager developer portal, see <a href="basics_forums.htm">Forums</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Analytics</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Analytics</strong> page provides API performance and health monitoring information (traffic, events, alerts comments, tickets, and so forth) for the API Admin. Chart presentations include Chart and Usage Log views. See <a href="apiadmin_monitoring.htm">Monitoring API Analytics</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Documentation</strong> page displays the reference documentation for the current API. Each API includes an API Overview and topics for each API Method. A typical organization might include Uses Cases, URI, Syntax, Sample Request, Request Parameters, Response Parameters, Sample Response, Error Codes, and Related Topics sections. API Providers can use the <strong>File Manager</strong> to upload and manage documentation. See <a href="api_admin_content_guidelines.htm">Content Development Guidelines for API Admins</a> for details.</p>

<p><strong>Test Client</strong></p>
<p>Provides access to the Test Client testing tool, where you can test your app in the context of a specific API. You can also test an API anonymously (without any app context). For more information, see <a href="api_admin_testing_tc.htm">API Testing with Test Client</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Agreements</strong></p>
<p>Provides a listing of legal agreements associated with the current API. These agreements are typically about API usage requirements, limitations, liability, and service level expectations. The API Provider is responsible for providing and enforcing legal agreements. All users that have visibility rights to an API can view the legal agreements. API Providers can upload and manage the legal agreements using the <strong>File Manager</strong>. See <a href="api_admin_legal_agreement_maintenance.htm">Legal Agreement Maintenance</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Visibility</strong></p>
<p>Provides access to the Groups page, which provides a method of creating common interest groups around APIs that are defined with private visibility, and also allows the API Admin to invite independent groups on the platform to have visibility of the API. If the API is private, a platform user can only see it if he/she is a member of a group that has visibility. Group accounts are created, and member invitations are sent and managed by the API Provider or assigned API Administrator. Only API Administrators can create API Scope Groups or invite independent groups to have visibility of the API. See <a href="basics_groups.htm#h_api_scope_groups">API Scope Groups</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Admins</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Admins</strong> page allows API Providers to send out invitations to individuals to whom they want to grant administration privileges for their API. API administrators can then be viewed and managed in a summary listing. See <a href="api_admin_management.htm">API Admin Management</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Apps</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Apps</strong> page allows API Providers and designated API Administrators to manage approval of access requests for their API.</p>

<p><strong>Followers</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Followers</strong> page provides a list of members that are currently following the activity of the selected API.</p>
<p>For more information on working with these features, see <a href="apiadmin_overview.htm#apiadmin_how_manage_api">How do I manage my API?</a></p>
