<h2 id="lc_overview">What is Lifecycle Coordinator?</h2>
<p>Lifecycle Coordinator is a set of functions, with an associated user interface, that allows you to manage development and operational lifecycle of assets on the developer portal, such as apps and APIs, in a defined sequence of separate tenants.</p>
<p>For example, let's say your team designs an API. The API is in the development environment. When it's ready, you want to move it to the staging environment where it will be tested. Perhaps it fails testing and some changes are made, and an updated version needs to be tested. Then, when testing is complete, you want to move it to a production environment.</p>
<p>In the context of Lifecycle Coordinator, each of these different development environments is represented in a separate platform tenant. The promotion sequence across these environments is defined as a promotion topology in Lifecycle Coordinator, with the separate environments defined as separate Community Manager tenants within this topology. In other words, Lifecycle Coordinator acts as a hub in a hub-and-spoke configuration, with each tenant representing a spoke in the configuration.</p>
<p>Once setup is complete, authorized users can promote assets between environments.</p>

<h2 id="lc_deployment_architecture">What options are available for the deployment architecture of my Lifecycle Coordinator topology?</h2>
<p>The deployment architecture is flexible. Tenants can be on the same machine or on different machines. For example, in a scenario where you have a topology of three tenants:</p>
<ul>
	<li>On one container you could create Tenant 1, Tenant 2, and Tenant 3.</li>
	<li>You can have three different containers on three different machines, each with one tenant.</li>
	<li>You can have a hybrid structure where two or more tenants are on one machine, and another&#8212;for example, Production&#8212;can be on a different machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Lifecycle Coordinator instance connecting these tenants can be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Deployed on a separate machine.</li>
	<li>Co-located on the same machine as one or more of the tenants. </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="lc_feature_req">What features do I install and configure to use Lifecycle Coordinator?</h2>
<p>To use Lifecycle Coordinator, you'll need to have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A working instance of Lifecycle Coordinator. The promotion sequence is defined in this instance.
		<div>
			<div> </div>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>An implementation of Community Manager, with at least two environments; each is a separate platform tenant. You'll promote assets (apps and APIs) between the tenants. A common scenario is to have a promotion sequence of three tenants&#8212;Development, Staging, and Production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the promotion topology is configured in the Lifecycle Coordinator instance, authorized users in each tenant can promote assets (apps and APIs) to the next environment. The authorized Lifecycle Coordinator user can manage promotion requests within the Lifecycle Coordinator user interface. </p>

<h2 id="lc_setup_role">Who can set up the Lifecycle Coordinator user interface (UI)?</h2>
<p>The Site Admin sets up the Lifecycle Coordinator user interface.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="lc_user_role">Who can use the Lifecycle Coordinator UI?</h2>
<p>There are two categories of user defined for the Lifecycle Coordinator UI:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>LC User</strong>: Sees all requests for the promotion sequence, and can approve or reject promotion requests.</li>
	<li><strong>LC Administrator</strong>: Cannot approve or reject promotion requests, but can cancel requests. Users with the LC Administrator role see a separate page, <strong>Admin</strong>, which isn't available to the LC User. See <a href="#lc_ui_admin_page">What activities can I perform on the Lifecycle Coordination Admin (Requests) page?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The same user can have both roles.</p>
<p>These roles are assigned in Policy Manager: <strong>Workbench</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong>. Assign the applicable role to the user. For instructions, see <a href="../../ag/security_admin/roles.htm#role_assign">Assigning a role to a user</a> (Policy Manager help).</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="lc_setup_how">How do I set up Lifecycle Coordinator?</h2>
<p>The Site Admin sets up the Lifecycle Coordinator user interface.</p>

<h4 id="proc_lc_setup">To set up Lifecycle Coordinator</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in as the Site Admin, in the first tenant of the topology (or in the dummy tenant created as part of a standalone Lifecycle Coordinator instance), and <a href="site_admin_overview.htm#admin_menu_siteadmin">go to the Admin section</a>.</li>
	<li>Go to <strong>Site</strong>.</li>
	<li>At the bottom, in the Themes section, click <strong>Add Theme</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Theme</strong> field, choose <strong>devops</strong>, as shown below.
	<p><img src="assets/lc_install_theme.jpg" alt="Adding the LC theme" /></p></li>
	<li>Specify additional values for the Lifecycle Coordinator user interface (for help with field values, see <a href="site_admin_site.htm#settings_theme_configure">How do I configure values for a theme?</a>):
	<ul>
		<li>One or more virtual hosts or vanity hostnames for the LC UI.</li>
		<li>The full console address for the theme, including trailing backslash.</li>
		<li>The site title.</li>
		<li>The site meta description.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
	<li>On the Site Settings page, click <strong>Save</strong> to confirm.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="lc_ui_promotion_requests_page">What activities can I perform on the Promotion Requests page?</h2>
<p>On the <strong>Promotion Requests</strong> page, the Lifecycle Coordinator user can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Filter the view of promotion requests: see <a href="#lc_ui_promotion_requests_page_filter">How do I filter the list of promotion requests?</a> below.</li>
	<li>Approve a promotion request: click the <strong>Approve</strong> button.</li>
	<li>Reject a promotion request: click the <strong>Reject</strong> button.</li>
	<li>View request details: click the request name (a link). See <a href="#lc_ui_promotion_request_details">How do I view promotion request details?</a> below.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="proc_lc_promreq_page">To get to the Promotion Requests page:</h4>
<p>Log in to the Lifecycle Coordinator user interface. The URL is the Console Address value set up in devops theme definition for the tenant associated with the Lifecycle Coordinator instance (see <a href="#proc_lc_setup">To set up Lifecycle Coordinator</a> above).</p>
<p> Lifecycle Coordinator opens at the <strong>Promotion Requests</strong> page, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/lc_ui_requests_page.jpg" alt="The LC UI Promotion Requests page" /></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>








<h2 id="lc_ui_promotion_requests_page_filter">How do I filter the list of promotion requests?</h2>
<p>You might have a large number of promotion requests to approve or reject, and might want to prioritize. Or, you might need to find a specific promotion request.</p>
<p>The <strong>Promotion Requests</strong> page includes filtering options to help you tailor your view as needed, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#lc_ui_filter_search">Search string</a></li>
	<li><a href="#lc_ui_filter_env">Environment drop-down list</a></li>
	<li><a href="#lc_ui_filter_filter">Filter drop-down list</a></li>
</ul>


<h4 id="lc_ui_filter_search">Search string</h4>
<p>Use the <strong>Search Requests</strong> field to search for promotion requests matching any string you enter, with or without additional filters.</p>

<h4 id="lc_ui_filter_env">Environment drop-down list</h4>
<p>Search by environment. The drop-down list includes all environments in your topology sequence. An example is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/lc_ui_requests_page_environments.jpg" alt="Promotion Requests page: Environments drop-down list" /></p>

<h4 id="lc_ui_filter_filter">Filter drop-down list</h4>
<p>Search by page status. The drop-down list includes all available statuses, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/lc_ui_requests_page_status.jpg" alt="Promotion Requests page: Page status drop-down list" /></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="lc_ui_promotion_request_details">How do I view promotion request details?</h2>
<p>From the <strong>Promotion Requests</strong> page, you have a summary view of each request, and can approve or deny a request with one click. However, you might want to view additional information about a promotion request.</p>
<p>In a specific promotion request, click the title. The details page appears, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/lc_ui_details_page.jpg" alt="The LC UI Promotion Request details page" /></p>
<p>From here, you can review additional information about the request, including history. You can also approve or reject the request from this page.</p>
<p>To return to the main <strong>Promotion Requests</strong> page, just click the <strong>Go back to Promotion Requests</strong> link.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="promotion_request_approve">What happens when I approve a promotion request?</h2>
<p>When you approve a promotion request, the change takes effect immediately. The asset remains in the original environment, but is also promoted to the next environment in the sequence. You might need to refresh the browser to see the change.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="promotion_request_reject">What happens when I reject a promotion request?</h2>
<p>When you reject a promotion request, the promotion status of the asset is displayed as <strong>Rejected</strong>. There are no further workflow actions with regard to that promotion request, such as Resubmit. The user who made the request, or another user, can initiate a new promotion request for the same asset at any time. At that point, the promotion status of the asset changes to <strong>Promotion Pending</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="lc_ui_admin_page">What activities can I perform on the Lifecycle Coordination Admin (Requests) page?</h2>
<p>If you're a Lifecycle Coordinator Admin, you have an additional page available to you. On the <strong>Admin</strong> page you have the following additional capabilities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Cancel requests. If you also have the LC User role, you can approve or reject promotion requests, but you must use the Promotion Requests page. The <strong>Requests</strong> page is only for cancelling requests.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="proc_lc_adminreq_page">To get to the Admin (Requests) page:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the LC user interface. Lifecycle Coordinator opens at the <strong>Promotion Requests</strong> page. Click the drop-down in the top menu bar, as shown below.
	<p><img src="assets/lc_ui_nav_admin.jpg" width="270" height="111" alt="LC UI: Opening the Admin page" /></p></li>
		<li>The <strong>Requests</strong> page is displayed.
<p><img src="assets/lc_ui_admin_page.jpg" alt="The LC UI Admin (Requests)page" /></p></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="lc_promotion_request_status">What are the valid statuses and lifecycle for a promotion request?</h2>
<p>Before a promotion request occurs, an asset has a lifecycle status of <strong>Not Promoted</strong>.</p>
<p>When a promotion request occurs, the lifecycle status changes to <strong>Promotion Pending</strong>.</p>
<p>If the request is approved, the status for the next environment changes to <strong>Approved</strong>.</p>
<p>If the request is rejected, the status for the next environment changes to <strong>Rejected</strong>.</p>
<p>If the request is cancelled, the status changes to <strong>Promotion Failed</strong>.</p>
<p>Within the Lifecycle Coordinator user interface, you can filter requests by the following statuses:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All</li>
	<li>Approved</li>
	<li>Promotion Pending</li>
	<li>Promotion Failed</li>
	<li>Rejected</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="lc_lm_additional">Additional approval functionality available in Lifecycle Manager</h2>
<p>This document provides information about the approval functionality available in Lifecycle Coordinator. Some additional functionality is available in the full Lifecycle Manager product, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Display or population of request properties.</li>
	<li>Comment-only approvers (an optional role that allows the user to comment on a request, to potentially provide information that might guide the approver in making an approve/reject decision).</li>
</ul>
