<a name="what_is_a_scope_and_how_does_it_work"></a><h3>What is a scope and how does it work?</h3>
<p>A scope is an entity that you define to represent any subdivision of an API that you might want to have separate control of. In the platform, the Business Admin can define a set of scopes and can then define licenses that include scopes as building blocks. A license is made up of one or more license terms plus legal agreements; a license term is made up of one or more scopes plus Quality of Service policies.</p>
<p>The API admin can then map the scopes to actual operations, completing the license definition for that specific API.</p>
<p><strong>Visibility:</strong></p>
<p>You can also manage API visibility using scopes. For example, you could define a scope as private. Whatever the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">visibility</a> setting is for the API, operations that are part of a private scope can only be seen by an individual who is a member of a group specifically invited to have visibility of a license that includes the scope.</p>
<p><strong>Granularity:</strong></p>
<p>You can define one scope for all operations or use multiple scopes. For example, you could have a scope for Read-Only operations and a second scope for all other operations. Or you could define one public scope for all operations except two or three that are in beta, and create a new private scope, Beta, for the new ones. You could then invite select users to access the beta operations, while your main body of users are unaware that beta testing is going on. They would simply not see the beta operations.</p>
<p>Scopes are a tool that enhance the manageability of the API by allowing you to break the API into smaller units so it can be shared or monetized in different ways.</p>
<p><strong>Hierarchy:</strong></p>
<p>Scopes can be configured in a hierarchy, and can include sub-scopes in multiple levels:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a user has visibility to a scope, the same user has visibility to all sub-scopes.</li>
  <li>If an app has access to a scope, the same app has access to all sub-scopes.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Management:</strong></p>
<p>Some points to note with regard to managing scopes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Business Administrators can add, modify, or delete a scope.</li>
  <li>You can add a top-level scope using the <strong>Add Scope</strong> function.</li>
  <li>You can add a child to any existing scope, at any level. Just highlight the scope and select <strong>Add Child</strong>.</li>
  <li>You can edit an existing scope, but you cannot change the scope name.</li>
  <li>Each scope includes a <strong>Delete</strong> function that allows you to delete the definition. Scope definitions cannot be removed if they are in use (used in a license that's referenced in an active API contract), or if any active license definitions include the scope.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Configuration:</strong></p>
<p>You define scopes in the <em>Administration &gt; Scopes</em> section and then reference those scopes when defining a License.</p>

<a name="what_are_the_visiblity_rules_for_a_scope"></a><h3>What are the visibility rules for a scope?</h3>
<p>The following visibility rules apply for a scope:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A user can view all public scopes for an API that's public. If the API is private, the user must have visibility of the API, but needs no other special invitation.</li>
  <li>A user has visibility of operations that are assigned to all private scopes (including all its descendant scopes) that are included in all licenses that the user has permission to see based on one or more groups that the user belongs to.</li>
  <li>An app developer doesn't see scope information. The developer simply chooses a license when requesting API access. The developer's scope access is controlled by a) the scopes that are included in the license definition, and b) the operations that are assigned to the scope.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how_do_i_configure_a_scope"></a><h3>How do I configure a scope?</h3>
<p>You can configure a scope in the <em>Administration &gt; Scopes </em>section of the platform. Some points to note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The scope definition includes name, description, and other properties such as visibility.</li>
  <li>The scope definition is the broad stroke; the API Admin fills in the specific details when assigning scopes to operations at the API level.</li>
  <li>Scopes are organized on a <em>Scope Definitions</em> screen using a vertical navigation approach.</li>
  <li> The top level tier of the scope hierarchy represents the parent scope.</li>
  <li>You can move a scope anywhere in the hierarchy by selecting and dragging the scope to a new position.</li>
  <li>The <strong>+Add Scope</strong> function on the left panel allows you to add one or more scopes.</li>
  <li>You can add multiple levels of child scopes to an existing scope by clicking a scope definition in the hierarchy on the left panel, and selecting the <strong>+Add Child</strong> function on the right panel.</li>
  <li>You can modify a scope, but you cannot change the scope name.</li>
  <li>When you delete a scope, any child scopes are also deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Scopes can be configured by Business Administrators only. </em></p>
<h5>To add a scope:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Site Administration &gt; Scopes</em>. The <em>Scopes Definitions</em> screen displays.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>+Add Scope</strong>. In the right panel, specify the Scope Name, Description (Short and Full), Visibility (Public/Private), Sandbox Access and Production Access options, and OAuth. <br />

<a name="what_is_the_relationship_between_a_license_and_a_scope"></a><h3>What is the relationship between a license and a scope?</h3>
<p>A license is a logical grouping of license terms plus optional end-user legal agreements. Each license term can include one or more scopes and one or more Quality of Service (QoS) policies. Licenses are defined by the Business Admin.</p>
<p>At the API level, if the Licenses feature is used, API operations are assigned to scopes. Scopes are the link between the API and the license.</p>
<p>When an app developer requests access to the API as part of the API Access Request process (via <em>Access</em> on the <em>API &gt; Details</em> page), the developer sees a choice of one or more licenses. The scopes are not seen by the developer, but are part of the license definition.</p>
<p><em>Note: If a License or scope that is referenced by a License is updated, any pending or approved API Access Requests are automatically updated. </em></p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="app_access_apis_api_access.htm">API Access</a> section.</p>

<a name="how_do_i_edit_a_scope"></a><h3>How do I edit a scope?</h3>
<p>You can modify a parent or child scope as long as it isn't in use in an API access contract.</p>
<h5>To edit a scope:</h5>

  <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<a name="how_do_i_delete_a_scope"></a><h3>How do I delete a scope?</h3>
<p>You can modify a parent or child scope as long as it isn't in use in an API access contract. If you delete scope that has children, the child scopes are also deleted.</p>
<h5>To delete a scope:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Site Administration &gt; Scopes</em>. The <em>Scope Definitions</em> screen displays.</li>
