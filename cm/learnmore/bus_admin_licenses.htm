<h2 id="what_is_a_license">What is a license?</h2>
<p>A license is a tailored API access package designed by the Business Admin/API Admin and offered to the app developer. A license includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>One or more License Terms, each of which can include multiple scopes, giving access to specifically designated operations, and multiple quality of service (QoS) agreements.</li>
	<li>One or more legal agreements applicable to the license.</li>
</ul>
<p>API visibility is controlled at the license level and also at the Scope level. This means that the license feature can be used not only to package an API for the purposes of monetization, development, or for any other reason, but also to control visibility so that only members of designated user groups can even see portions of the API (and the associated documentation). API access is granted at the license level.</p>
<p><strong>Defining a License:</strong></p>
<p>Business Administrators can define a license in the<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&#160;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&#160;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Licenses</strong> section using the <strong>+Add License</strong> function. As a prerequisite to defining a license you must have scopes pre-defined. Scopes are part of the license definition.</p>
<p>Some points to note when defining a license:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It's best to define scopes first. You can define a license without adding Scopes, but a license is meaningless without at least one scope assigned to it.</li>
	<li>As part of the license, you must define one or more <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_licenseterm">license terms</a>.</li>
	<li>One or more Scopes can be assigned a license using the <strong>Add Scope</strong> function.</li>
	<li>Each Scope can be tailored using the <strong>Select Scope</strong> function (you can select or deselect specific tiers within the Scope).</li>
	<li>After you save the license, the API Admin must specify that the API uses licenses, and must map scopes to operations within the API (scope mapping). If the license is private, the API Admin must also create an API Scope Group or invite other groups to access the API and specify that the groups have access to that license. Once those steps are complete, applicable licenses are available for app developers to select in the API Access Wizard.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="what_is_a_license_term">What is a license term?</h2>
<p>A license term is a building block for a license. A license is made up of one or more license terms plus, optionally, one or more legal agreements. When defining a license, you define one or more license terms. Each license term is unique to the license that it is a part of; license terms do not exist separately from licenses.</p>
<p>A license term includes two components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The access that is being offered in terms of what exactly the user is being given access to (<a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_scope">scope</a>); for example, access to read-only operations, access to credit card operations, access to all operations.</li>
	<li> The level of access in terms of quality of service and/or volume of transactions (<a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_qospolicy">QoS policy</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each license term includes one or more scopes plus, optionally, the quality of service limits/<a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy">policies</a> to be applied to all scopes in the license term. Scopes apply to both visibility and access; policies apply only to access. To have any impact, a license term must include at least one scope.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="what_are_the_visiblity_rules_for_a_license">What are the visibility rules for a license?</h2>
<p>The following visibility rules apply for a license:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Public licenses are always available for selection in the API Access Request wizard.</li>
	<li>Private licenses are only visible to an app developer if the developer's visibility scope for an API version includes that license. This happens when a group that the developer is a member of has access to the license.</li>
	<li>A public API can have a private license. In this scenario, all users see the parts of the API that are not included in the private license. The operations that are in the private license, and their corresponding documentation, are only visible to users who have explicit access to all scopes within that license.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_do_i_add_a_license">How do I add a license?</h2>
<p>You can configure a license using the <strong>Add License</strong> function in the<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&#160;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&#160;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Licenses</strong> section of the platform:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Scopes must be predefined in the<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&#160;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&#160;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Scopes</strong> section so that they are available for selection when defining the license.</li>
	<li>Quality of Service (QoS) policies must be defined in <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy_manager">Policy Manager</a>.</li>
	<li>The process of configuring a license involves assigning a name and description, configuring the approval level for Sandbox and Live Access (Auto Approved or Approval Required), setting <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">Visibility</a> (Public or Private), and defining one or more license terms, each of which includes one or more scopes and QoS policies that will apply to the license (in the<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&#160;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&#160;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Licenses</strong> section).</li>
	<li>You can upload legal agreements during the license creation process.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Add Term</strong> function allows you to add a license term. A license can include multiple terms, each of which can include one or more scopes and QoS policies.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Delete</strong> function allows you to delete a license definition line item.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Licenses can only be configured by Business Administrators.</p>
<h4 id="license_add">To add a license</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Community Manager developer portal as the Business Admin.</li>
	<li>Go to<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&#160;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&#160;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Licenses</strong>.</li>
	<li>On the <strong>Licenses</strong> page, click <strong>Add License</strong>. Specify the Name, Description, Visibility (Public/Private), and Sandbox Access and Live Access options you would like to assign to the license definition.

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Public</strong>: A public license is visible to app developers when requesting API access for an app.
						<p>If there is documentation or downloadable content for a public API's licenses, scopes, or operations that are designated with a visibility of public, those resources are visible to all users. If the API itself is private but the scope is public, the resources are visible to all users who have been invited to the API.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Private</strong>: A private license is visible only to an app developer who is a member of one or more groups invited to have <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">visibility</a> of the license.
						<p>If an app developer's visibility scope for an API version includes a private license, that developer will have the option to choose that license when requesting API access.</p>
						<p>If a license is private, only users that have the license in their visibility scope can access the API documentation/downloadable files that are mapped to the license.</p>
						<p><strong>Note</strong>: The API admin must make sure that the documentation is appropriately tagged. If it is not, it will not be visible even to authorized individuals. For information on tagging API documentation, see <a href="api_admin_documentation_tagging.htm#how_do_i_control_visibility_of_api_documentation">How do I control visibility of API documentation files?</a></p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Auto Approval</strong>: If an app requests Sandbox API access for one or more licenses all of which are set to Sandbox Access &gt;Auto Approved, the API access request is auto approved.</li>
					<li><strong>Approval Required:</strong> If any one of the licenses is set to Sandbox Access &gt; Auto Approved, the API access request is placed in a Pending Approval state until approved by the API Admin.</li>
					</ul></td>

	<li>Choose one or more legal agreements that will apply to the license. If needed, you can add or upload a new legal agreement:
		<ul>
			<li>If necessary, first upload the file: click <strong>Upload Legal</strong>.</li>
			<li>Add the legal document to the license: click Add Legal and define display name and description, and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the license is defined, the API Admin or Business Admin can apply the license to the API. The steps are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure the API is using licenses (License check box checked in the API definition).</li>
	<li>Map operations to scopes (scope mapping option from the API page).</li>
	<li>If the API is private, create an API Scope Group or invite existing groups to have visibility of the API.</li>
	<li>If the license is private, specifically invite groups to have visibility of those licenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once those steps are complete, the license will be available to app developers when making an API access request.</p>

<h2 id="how_do_i_deactivate_or_reactivate_a_license">How do I deactivate or reactivate a license?</h2>
<p>You can deactivate a license definition on the <strong>License Definitions</strong> page. Note:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When you deactivate a license it still exists on the License Definitions page, but is not available for selection on the <strong>Licenses</strong> page in the <strong>API Access Wizard</strong>.</li>
	<li>You can edit the license when it is deactivated.</li>
	<li>You cannot deactivate a license if it is in use in a current API access request or contract. You must first cancel any pending or approved API Access Requests.</li>
</ul>
<h4>To deactivate a license</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Community Manager developer portal as the Business Admin.</li>
	<li>Go to<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&#160;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&#160;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Licenses</strong>.</li>

<p>You can delete a license on the <strong>License Definitions</strong> page:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You cannot delete a License if it is in use (that is, if it was selected as part of an API Access Request). You must first cancel any pending or approved API Access Requests.</li>
</ul>
<h4>To delete a license</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Community Manager developer portal as the Business Admin.</li>
	<li>Go to<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&#160;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&#160;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Licenses</strong>.</li>

</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>




<h2 id="how_do_i_add_a_policy">How do I add a policy to a license?</h2>
<p>The Licenses feature uses policies as a component when building the license definition; policies are an optional component in license terms. However, policies are defined outside the platform, in <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy_manager">Policy Manager</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as the policy is defined in the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_api_gateway">API Gateway</a>, it is available for selection when you go to<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/hdr_more_admin.lbi" -->&#160;<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;&#160;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><strong>Licenses</strong>, click <strong>Add License</strong>, and add a license term to the license.</p>
<p>If you want to create licenses but the policies are not set up yet, you can go ahead and set up the licenses without the policies, and then go back and add the policies when they're available.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_do_i_modify_a_policy">How do I modify a policy?</h2>
<p>You can modify a policy by changing the policy definition in <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy_manager">Policy Manager</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="how_do_i_delete_a_policy">How do I delete a policy?</h2>
<p>If you want to delete a policy, it must be done in <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy_manager">Policy Manager</a>, where the policies are set up. Note that you can only delete a policy that is not in use.</p>
<p>You <strong>cannot</strong> delete a policy if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There is a license definition that references the policy.</li>
	<li>There is an active or pending API access contract that references the policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="how_do_i_assign_a_license_to_an_api">How do I assign a license to an API?</h2>
<p>The API Admin or Business Admin links license definitions to an API by completing the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the API setup, making sure the <strong>Choose Licenses</strong> check box is selected.</li>
<li>From the API page, assigning scopes to the API (scope mapping).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once those steps are complete, any licenses that include those scopes in the license definition are presented to the app developer for selection when the app developer initiates an API access request.</p>
