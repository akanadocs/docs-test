<a name="legal_agreement_define"></a><h3>What is the platform legal agreement?</h3>
<p>You might want to have a platform legal agreement in place, that all platform users are required to accept. If a legal agreement is in place, the platform requires users to accept the agreement in these scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As part of completing the initial login process.</li>
  <li>On next login if the legal agreement changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can upload more than one agreement document, but only one can be active. You can change the legal agreement at any time, or deactivate it. Remember that every time you change the legal agreement, every user must accept the new agreement at next login.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: The platform supports use of only one legal agreement. Make sure all the legal requirements are combined into one document.</p>

</ul>

<a name="how_do_i_add_a_platform_signup_legal_agreement"></a><h3>How do I add a platform signup legal agreement?</h3>
<p>To add a legal agreement there are two steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, upload the legal agreement file to the <strong>content/system/agreements</strong> folder. See <a href="#p_legal_agreement_upload">Step 1: To upload a new legal agreement to the Akana API platform</a> below.</li>
  <li>Then, make the new agreement the default for the platform. See <a href="#p_legal_agreement_specify">Step 2: To set a specific legal agreement as the default for the platform</a> below.</li>
</ol>
<h5><a name="p_legal_agreement_upload"></a>Step 1: To upload a new legal agreement to the Akana API platform</h5>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Follow the procedure below to upload a legal agreement directly to the correct folder. This is the fastest way to do it. However, you can also upload via <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Resources</strong> &gt; <strong>Content</strong>. You'd then need to create the rest of the folder structure before uploading the file. It doesn't matter how the legal agreement is uploaded but it must be in the <strong>content/system/agreements</strong> folder.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Site Admin.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Agreements</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Upload Agreement</strong>.
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: this functionality is only available to the Site Admin. If you don't see the <strong>Upload Agreement</strong> button on the right, you don't have the appropriate permissions.</p></li>
  <li>In File Manager, <strong>click Upload a File</strong>, then navigate to the location of the new developer agreement and upload it (for example, it could be a .txt, .htm, or .html file). The content is uploaded automatically to the <strong>content/system/agreements</strong> folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've uploaded the legal agreement, the next step is to make it the default for the platform. See below.</p>
<h5><a name="p_legal_agreement_specify"></a>Step 2: To set a specific legal agreement as the default for the platform</h5>
<p>Before setting the legal agreement as the default for the platform, you must upload it. See <strong>Step 1</strong> above.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Site Admin.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Agreements</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add Agreement</strong>.
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: this functionality is only available to the Site Admin. If you don't see the <strong>Add Agreement</strong> button on the right, you don't have the appropriate permissions.</p></li>
  <li>Specify values:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Name</strong>: Used internally.</li>
      <li><strong>Description</strong>: Displayed to users above the legal agreement when the user is logging in for the first time, or at the next login if the legal agreement changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Path</strong>: Browse for the agreement users must accept. You can only choose a file previously uploaded to the content/system/agreements folder as per <a href="#p_legal_agreement_upload">Step 1</a> above.</li>
      <li><strong>Printable Content Path</strong> (optional): Browse for the agreement users can print. It can be the same file or a more print-friendly file format such as PDF. You can include a link to this file from the main developer agreement so that users can print.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  
  <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>. The legal agreement immediately becomes the default for the platform, and new or existing users will need to accept it to log in.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can upload more than one legal agreement. If you have more than one, they display in a list view in the Legal Agreements page. However, only one can be active.</p>
