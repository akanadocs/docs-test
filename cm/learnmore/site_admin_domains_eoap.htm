<a name="why_choose_eoap"></a><h3>When would I choose an External OAuth Provider domain?</h3>
<p>If your installation uses any external OAuth provider, such as PingFederate or even the Akana OAuth Provider in a different installation, you can choose the External OAuth Provider domain option. Using this option, you can implement multiple OAuth Providers in the platform.</p>
<p>For example, you might have two installations; one has the platform OAuth Provider, and the second does not, but wants to integrate with the platform OAuth Provider. You could use this domain to accomplish that, configuring this domain to reference the external Akana OAuth Provider.</p>
<p>If you are using PingFederate, and were previously using the PingFederate domain option, we recommend that you switch to the External OAuth Provider domain. This domain is more flexible and also offers auto-configure of apps that have active contracts with APIs that reference the External OAuth Provider domain. Manual configuration of the apps in PingFederate is not necessary.</p>

<a name="domain_add_eoap"></a><h3>How do I add an External OAuth Provider domain?</h3>
<p>The Site Admin can set up an External OAuth Provider domain in the developer portal UI.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: adding or modifying the domain configuration on the platform does not add or modify configuration with the OAuth Provider itself. You must set up values in the platform to match configuration at the OAuth Provider.</p>
<h5><a name="to_add_domain_eoap"></a>To configure an external OAuth provider domain:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Click the <em>Administration</em> quick filter (wrench icon).</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Domains</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add Domain</strong> and choose <strong>External OAuth Provider</strong>. The Add External OAuth Provider wizard opens at the Details page. This wizard has five pages:
    <ul>
      <li>Details</li>
      <li>Configure</li>
      <li>Provider</li>
      <li>Token Validation</li>
      <li>Extensions</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
  <li>Enter a name and description for your external OAuth provider (for example, Name=PingFederate, Description=PingFederate Domain).</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the <strong>Configure</strong> page. Here you will specify the type of external provider and how you want to configure the provider. Specify values or choose options. For more information, see <a href="#settings_eoap_configure">What are the settings on the External OAuth Provider Configure page and what options should I choose?</a> </li>
   <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the <strong>Provider</strong> page. This page includes information about the external OAuth Provider. If you provided a Well-Known Configuration URL, the information is read from the configuration file, but you can modify if needed. If you are doing manual configuration you must specify the values. For more information, see <a href="#settings_eoap_provider">What are the settings on the Provider page and what options should I choose?</a> </li>
 <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the <strong>Token Validation</strong> page. If you want the  access token to be validated by the Resource Server, click the checkbox and specify values that will be needed for the validation, such as claim names and keys. For more information see <a href="#settings_eoap_token_validation">What are the settings on the External OAuth Provider Token Validation page and what options should I choose?</a></li>
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the <strong>Extensions</strong> page. If your external OAuth Provider supports one or more extensions, you'll see them in this tab. Check the box if you want your External OAuth Provider Domain to support a specific extension that your external OAuth Provider offers, and then enter values associated with the extension. If you need help with any of the fields, check with your external OAuth Provider.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The OAuth Provider domain is saved, and is now available for selection by API Admins when setting up OAuth details (<strong>API Details page</strong> &gt; <strong>OAuth Details</strong>).</li>
</ol>

<a name="settings_eoap_configure"></a><h3>What are the settings on the External OAuth Provider Configure page and what options should I choose?</h3>

Provide the URL ({oauth-provider-url}/.well-known/openid-configuration) and then click <strong>Load</strong>. You'll be able to edit the information afterwards if needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Well-Known Configuration JSON</strong>: Reads the JSON you copy from the configuration file. Paste the JSON and then click <strong>Load</strong>. You'll be able to edit the information afterwards if needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Manually</strong>: Choose this option if you want to set up your provider domain by providing all the values yourself, without reference to any external configuration information, or if your provider doesn't support the OpenID Connect Discovery Endpoint.</li>

<p>If there are changes to your external OAuth Provider domain configuration, you'll need to update the domain settings in the platform.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The procedure below only updates the platform settings; it doesn't change any external configuration with the external OAuth Provider. To change to the external OAuth Provider configuration, you must first make the changes with the provider itself, and then update the platform settings to match the provider configuration, using the procedure below.</p>
<h5>To modify an External OAuth Provider domain in the developer portal</h5>

  <li>Log in as the Site Admin and click the <em>Administration</em> quick filter (wrench icon).</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Domains</strong>. The <em>Domains Summary</em> page displays.</li>
  <li>Find the domain on the list and click <strong>Modify</strong>. The <em>Edit</em> wizard for the specific domain type displays.</li>
