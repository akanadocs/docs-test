<h2 id="models_overview">Model Library: Overview</h2>
<p>The Model Library feature allows the Business Admin to create and manage a shared repository of models for common data types (for example, customer, product, location) so that APIs and API consumers can work with consistent data definitions across all APIs. It supports <a href="http://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#draft-4" title="Link to JSON Schema Draft 4 specification" target="_blank">JSON Schema Draft 4</a>.</p>
<p>Some key features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can define a model object from scratch, or you can upload a schema file. The schema can include multiple model objects within it, and you can choose which model objects to import.</li>
	<li>You can define categories for your model objects, to assist in organizing and searching. One default category, <strong>global</strong>, is provided.</li>
	<li>You can maintain multiple versions of any model object. To define a new version, clone or design from scratch.</li>
	<li>There is a built-in approval process for model object versions: design, then request approval, then approve/reject. Once approved, a model object is available to API developers for use when designing an API. If approval is rejected, the model object version goes back to Draft state.</li>
	<li>There are two new roles to support the model approval process:
		<ul>
			<li>Model Designer, who can add, modify, or delete model objects at the business level.</li>
			<li>Model Administrator, who can approve or reject model objects.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Different versions of one model object can be in different approval states, so that the previous version is in use while an updated version is in development.</li>

		<li>Before deleting a model object version, you must make sure that all references to it are deleted. If there are references, you won't be able to delete it. See <a href="#model_objects_referencing">Referencing model objects</a> below.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="model_objects_referencing">Referencing model objects</h3>
<p>A model object can be referenced by another model object and/or by one or more APIs in the business. The behavior is slightly different, as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the Business Admin or Model Designer links from one model object to another in the Model Library, a reference is created.
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You must remove all references of this type to a model object version before deleting it.</p></li>
	<li>If the user references a model object in the context of an API, it becomes local to the API.
	<p>In this scenario, you can delete a model object version. The version still remains available for all APIs that are referencing it.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_bus_models">Business Models</h2>




<h2 id="model_define">What is a model?</h2>
<p>In the API Platform, a model is the schema for a model object that is available for selection when adding or modifying APIs in the entire business organization. When adding an API, a user can define models in the context of that API; however, models defined at the business level, in the Model Library, can be used across multiple APIs within the business. This helps ensure consistent data definitions across APIs.</p>
<p>A model can have multiple versions. If there are multiple versions, each one can have a different state. As with apps and APIs, when you create the first model you automatically create the first version also.</p>
<p>All activities relating to models, such as requesting approval, approving, and referencing a model, are for a specific model version.</p>



<h2 id="org_model_manage">How do I manage models for my business organization on the platform?</h2>
<p>The API platform allows you to manage the models that are available for your business organization. You can:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#org_model_add">Add a model</a> (by designing from scratch or by importing)</li>
	<li><a href="#org_model_modify">Modify a model</a></li>
	<li><a href="#org_model_view">View models</a></li>
	<li><a href="#org_model_delete">Delete an existing model</a></li>
	<li><a href="#proc_model_version_add">Add a new version for a model</a></li>
	<li><a href="#org_model_approve_reject">Approve or reject a draft model</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A model is available only for the organization in which it was created.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="org_model_json_schema_version">What version of JSON Schema does the platform support?</h2>
<p>The platform supports <a href="http://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#draft-4" title="Link to JSON Schema Draft 4 specification" target="_blank">JSON Schema Draft 4</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="org_model_add">How do I add a model for my organization?</h2>
<p>There are two ways to add a model:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design from scratch. See <a href="#proc_model_add_scratch">To add a model from scratch</a> below.</li>
	<li>Import a model definition in a file. See <a href="#proc_model_add_upload">To add a model by uploading a file</a> below.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two steps to adding a model from scratch:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Define the basic information about the model, such as name, description, and model type: see <a href="#proc_model_add_scratch">To add a model from scratch</a> below.</li>
	<li>Define the details of the model object. See <a href="#org_model_schema_editor">How do I design a model in the JSON Schema Editor?</a> below.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="proc_model_add_scratch">To add a model from scratch</h4>
<ol>
	<li>In the developer portal, <a href="#proc_models_list">go to the Models list</a> for the organization. All models associated with the organization are displayed.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add</strong>. The <strong>Create Model</strong> page is displayed, as shown below.
	<p><img src="assets/model_create_from_scratch.png" alt="Adding a model - from scratch" /></p></li>
	<li>For the default option, <strong>Add Model from Scratch</strong>, specify <strong>Name</strong>, a short and clear name to distinguish the model; for example, <strong>Finance</strong>. Used on the model summary page.	This is the only required field.
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: The model name must be unique for the model category (see <strong>Model Category</strong> field below). You can have more than one model with the same name in the Model Library if they are in different categories.</p></li>
	<li>Optional: provide the following additional values:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Version ID</strong>: A short name for the model version; for example, <strong>v1</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>Summary</strong>: A short, plain-text field for internal display of a description of the model.</li>
			<li><strong>Model Category</strong>: Choose from the drop-down list to assign the model to a predefined logical category; for example, <strong>Finance</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Optional: on the right, click the <strong>Advanced Options</strong> swipe button (gray dot) and specify values for one or more of the following additional fields:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Description</strong>: An informative description of the model. Supports <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_markdown">Markdown</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Version Description</strong>: A concise description of the model version. Text only.</li>
		<li><strong>Visibility</strong>: default is Public. Change the visibility setting if needed. For valid values, see <a href="#org_model_visibility">What are the visibility settings for model objects on the API platform?</a> below. </li></ul></li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The model is added to the list of models for the organization, and you are taken to the <strong>Edit Schema</strong> page to define the schema for the model, as shown in the example below.
<p><img src="assets/schema_designer_01.jpg" alt="Schema Designer, initial view" /></p></li>
	<li>Define the model by using the JSON Schema Editor (default view, shown above), or the JSON Editor (click the JSON tab). For detailed instructions, see <a href="apiadmin_a_d_d_oas30.htm#h_json_schema_editor">JSON Schema Editor</a>.</li>
	<li>When done, click <strong>Save</strong>.
	</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="proc_model_add_upload">To add a model by uploading a file</h4>
<ol>
	
	<li>In the Community Manager developer portal, <a href="#proc_models_list">go to the Models list</a> for the organization. All models associated with the organization are displayed.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Create Model</strong> page, click <strong>Import Model File</strong> and choose your schema file. The platform reads the file and displays a list of models contained in it. An example is shown below.
	<p><img src="assets/model_create_import_file.png" alt="Importing a model" /></p></li>
	<li>Choose one or more models from the schema file. Top-level objects are selected by default; clear any options you don't want. At least one model must be selected. For information about how the Community Manager developer portal processes your models based on your choices, see <a href="apiadmin_a_d_d_oas30.htm#h_json_schema_editor">JSON Schema Editor</a> and also see <a href="#org_model_schema_refs">Treatment of inline references to other model objects in an uploaded model object schema</a> below.</li>
	<li>Optionally, specify a <strong>Model Category</strong>: Choose from the drop-down list to assign the model to a predefined logical category; for example, <strong>Finance</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The model is added to the list of models for the organization.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="org_model_schema_refs">Treatment of inline references to other model objects in an uploaded model object schema</h2>

<p>When you import a model file that includes references to another model, in the <strong>Create Model</strong> page, it might include references to another model. An example is shown below (only applicable portions of the file are shown).</p>
<pre>"...
  category": {
    "$ref": "#/definitions/Category"

...

  "definitions": {
    "Category": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Category",
      "properties": {
        "id": {
          "description": "id",
          "type": "integer",
          "format": "int64"
        },
        "name": {
          "description": "name",
          	"type": "string"
          }
      }
    },
...
</pre>
<p>In this scenario, the Community Manager developer portal offers you two options in the <strong>Create Model</strong> page:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>Preserve the references as part of the imported model object (inline references), as they are in the imported file. To do this, check only the top-level box and make sure the second-level boxes are cleared.</li>
	<li>Make the referenced model objects into separate model objects in your library. To do this, check the boxes for all model objects that should be created as separate models. The Community Manager portal creates separate model objects, and converts the top-level references in the main model object into links so that each separate model object is correctly referenced.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the second option, the developer portal creates a link to the second-level model object, as shown in the example below.</p>

<h4 id="org_model_schema_refs_eg">Importing a model object with inline references to other model objects: example</h4>
<p>Let's say you are importing this <a href="assets/pet_single_schema_with_ref.json">model object schema with inline references to two other model objects</a>. This schema, for the <strong>Pet</strong> model object, includes inline references to <strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Tag</strong> model objects.</p>
<p>When importing in the <strong>Create Model</strong> page, if you check only the top-level box, the Community Manager portal creates one model object that references the other two within it.</p>
<p>If you check all boxes, the portal creates three model objects. In the top-level object, Pet, the references to the embedded model objects are replaced with links to the new separate model objects.</p>
<p>Before converting to separate object:</p>
<pre>"$ref": "#/definitions/Tag"</pre>
<p>After converting to separate object:</p>
<pre> &quot;$ref&quot;: &quot;#/acmepaymentscorp/global/Tag&quot;</pre>
<p>Choose the second option if you want to be able to re-use model objects, and to be able to update in only one place if the model object changes.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="org_model_schema_editor">How do I design a model in the JSON Schema Editor?</h2>
<p>You might need to use the JSON Schema Editor in any of these scenarios:</p>
<ul>
	<li>When you design a model from scratch, the initial process allows you to define the metadata for the model, but the model is created with an empty JSON schema. You'll then need to define the design of the model itself.</li>
	<li>When you import a model from a file, the platform reads the file and uploads the JSON schema. However, you might want to modify the uploaded schema definition.</li>
	<li>When you're updating a model or creating a new version, you might need to modify the model design.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these scenarios, you can add or edit plain JSON in the JSON Designer, or you can use the JSON Schema Editor. The Editor:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provides additional functionality such as hints.</li>
	<li>Allows you to add dependencies and validations to help ensure consistency and accuracy in your JSON Schema.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can switch between the JSON Schema Editor view and the plain JSON view as needed.</p>
<p>The initial view in the JSON Schema Editor when creating a model from scratch is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/schema_designer_01.jpg" alt="Schema Designer, initial view" /></p>
<p>For full instructions on using the JSON Schema Editor, see <a href="apiadmin_a_d_d_oas30.htm#h_json_schema_editor">JSON Schema Editor</a> (API Admin help).</p>

<h4 id="proc_model_design">To design a model</h4>
<ol>
	<li>First, add the model; see <a href="#proc_model_add_scratch">To add a model from scratch</a> above.</li>
	<li>Go to the models list for the organization (<strong>Organizations</strong> &gt; <strong>organization</strong> &gt; <strong>Models</strong>).</li>
	<li>Find the model on the list and click the title to access the <strong>Overview</strong> page for the model.</li>
	<li>In the second section, <strong>Model Summary</strong>, click <strong>Edit</strong>. The JSON Schema Editor appears. Here, you can use all the features of the JSON Schema Editor to build the model you want. For full instructions, see <a href="apiadmin_a_d_d_oas30.htm#h_json_schema_editor">JSON Schema Editor</a> (API Admin help).</li>
	<li>When done, click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some things you can do in the JSON Schema Editor:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Import models that you've already defined.</li>
	<li>Use the contextual help (CTRL + spacebar) to guide you.</li>
	<li>Use the inline validation to guide you.</li>
	<li>Switch back and forth between the JSON Schema Editor and plain JSON view.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org_model_visibility">What are the visibility settings for model objects on the API platform?</h2>
<p>When you're adding or editing a model object or model object version, the following visibility settings are available:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Public</strong>: All users can see the model in search results, whether logged in or not.</li>
	<li><strong>Private</strong>: The model is only visible to users with roles authorized to view models. This includes:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>API Developer</strong> (Read permission)</li>
			<li><strong>API Owner</strong> (Read permission)</li>
			<li><strong>API Admin</strong> (Read permission)</li>

	<li>Approves the request. The model object version becomes active and is available for selection when designing APIs and other model objects.</li>
	<li>Rejects the request. The model object version goes back to Draft state until the Model Designer resubmits for approval or deletes the model object.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org_model_version_manage">How do I manage model versions?</h2>
<p>You can have multiple versions of a model, just as you can have multiple versions of an app or API. Each version is managed separately, and you can:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#proc_model_version_modify">Modify a version</a></li>
	<li><a href="#proc_model_version_add">Add a new version for a model</a></li>
	<li><a href="#proc_model_version_delete">Delete a version</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When an API Admin is referencing a model defined at the business level, the user interface lists the version as well as the model, so that the API Admin can choose the appropriate version of the model.</p>

<h2 id="org_model_categories">What is a model category?</h2>
<p>A model <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_category_model">category</a> is a logical grouping that can be used for model objects. The model object category is defined by the Business Admin (<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Model Categories</strong>).</p>
<p>There is one default category, <strong>global</strong>, which cannot be changed. The Business Admin can add, modify, or delete any other model categories.</p>
<p>Each model can be assigned to a category. This allows logical grouping of model objects, and also facilitates search in a scenario where there are many models defined for a business. The <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_search">search</a> feature on the Models list allows searching by category.</p>
<p>You can have models of the same name if they are assigned to different categories. This allows </p>
<p>If you need additional model categories and cannot add them yourself, ask a Business Admin.</p>
