<a name="what_is_a_business"></a><h3>What is a Business?</h3>
<p>A Business is an entity that owns and publishes APIs. A business generally includes multiple APIs, Developers, and Apps. The platform represents the Business.</p>
<p><strong><u>Business Visibility</u></strong></p>
<p>A business can be defined as having public or private search <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">visibility</a>. The visibility setting determine whether the business appears in search results and whether users can see summary information for the Business, as described below.</p>

<a name="what_functions_are_available_to_the_business_administrator"></a><h3>What functions are available to the Business Administrator on the platform?</h3>
<p>When you have full permission as a Business Admin on the platform, at the root level (rather than for a specific business organization), there are two additional options available to you, accessible from the top navigation bar:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Organizations</strong> option: for activities associated with a specific organization.</li>
  <li><strong>Administration</strong> option: for all activities performed at the root level, for the entire API platform.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Business Admin: Organizations option</h5>
<p>The Organizations menu gives you access to functionality relating to organizations created on the API platform. For information about adding and managing organizations, see <a href="bus_admin_organizations.htm">Organizations</a>.</p>
<p>To get to the Organizations menu: Log in to the developer portal and click Organizations (see <a href="bus_admin_organizations.htm#proc_businesses_list">To access the Organizations List</a>). Click through on a specific organization, and you'll see the left menu.</p>
<h5>Business Admin: Administration option</h5>
<p>The following functions are available to the Business Admin on the <strong>Administration</strong> menu, for activities performed at the root level for the entire API platform.</p>
<table width="600" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <td width="50%"><strong>Default Theme:</strong></td>
        <td width="50%"><strong>Hermosa Theme:</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align:top;"><p><img src="assets/menu_left_busadmin_default.jpg" alt="Left menu for Business Admins, Organizations, Default Theme" /></p>
</td>
        <td><img src="assets/menu_left_busadmin_hermosa.jpg" alt="Left menu for Business Admins, Organizations, Hermosa Theme" /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Business Admins</strong>&#8212;Manage business administrators on the platform, including inviting and removing business administrators. See <a href="bus_admin_bus_admin.htm">Business Admins</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Deployment Zones</strong>&#8212;Manage deployment zones on the platform. See <a href="bus_admin_dzs.htm">Managing Deployment Zones</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Domains</strong>&#8212;Configure domains. See <a href="bus_admin_domains.htm">Domains</a>.</li>
  <li><strong></strong><strong>Forum</strong>&#8212;Moderate user-generated content relating to platform apps and APIs, such as discussions, reviews, and comments. See <a href="bus_api_admin_forum.htm">Forum Moderation</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Licenses</strong>&#8212;Define licenses that can be used by APIs to define what's offered to app developers. See <a href="bus_admin_licenses.htm">Licenses</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Scopes</strong>&#8212;Create and manage scopes, a key component of licenses. See <a href="bus_admin_scopes.htm">Scopes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="what_roles_can_a_business_administrator_perform"></a><h3>What roles can a Business Administrator perform?</h3>

  <li>API</li>
  <li>API version</li>
  <li>App</li>
  <li>App version</li>
  <li>Group</li>

<table cellspacing="0px" class="doctable" style="width: 98%;">

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Site Administrators have some of the same privileges as a Business Administrator. For example, a Site Administrator can invite another user to be a Business Administrator. However, Site Administrators do not have other rights of a Business Administrator, such as privileges to add, edit, or delete apps and APIs in the business. For more information, see <a href="site_admin_overview.htm#what_are_the_differences_between_site_admin_and_business_admin_roles">What are the differences between Site Admin and Business Admin roles?</a></p>

<a name="how_do_i_restrict_app_deletion"></a><h3>How do I restrict app deletion?</h3>
<p>If you want to set up a scenario where app deletion must be approved by a Business Admin, you can implement this out-of-the-box custom app workflow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>appversion-workflow-template1.xml</li>
</ul>
<p>If this workflow is in effect, and an app developer deletes an app version, the deletion request is sent to the Business Admin for approval. The app is inactivated pending approval; at this point, developers cannot make any changes to the app, although the Business Admin can still make changes. When the Business Admin approves the request, the app is deleted. If for any reason the Business Admin denies the request, the app is restored to normal operation.</p>
<p>To implement this custom workflow, the Site Admin must set it as the default for apps. For information, see <a href="site_admin_workflows.htm#how_do_i_specify_a_custom_workflow_for_apps">How do I specify a custom workflow for apps?</a> (Site Admin help).</p>
