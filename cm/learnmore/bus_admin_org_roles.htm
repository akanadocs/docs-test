<h2 id="business_security_manage">How do I manage security for my organization?</h2>
<p>The API platform allows you to assign one or more specific roles to users.</p>
<p>All roles defined in the underlying Policy Manager infrastructure, either for the root organization or for the current business organization, are available to be assigned to users in your organization.</p>
<p>This accommodates many use cases and allows you to assign rights to create, view, modify, and delete resources in your organization, to a very fine level of granularity. You can control user access rights to a much more detailed level than the Developer, API Admin, Business Admin, and Site Admin roles supported in versions of the API platform prior to version 8.3.</p>
<p>You can assign access roles to specific users in your organization via the <strong>Security</strong> page. See <a href="#business_assign_roles_to_users">How do I assign security roles to users for my organization?</a> below.</p>
<p>You can also add roles. Currently, new roles must be added in Policy Manager, and are then available for selection in the API Platform UI. Roles added at the root organization level are available for all organizations; you can also add one or more roles for a specific organization, and they are available only for that organization.</p>
<p>For information on adding roles in Policy Manager, refer to the Policy Manager help.</p>

<h2 id="business_assign_roles_to_users">How do I assign security roles to users for my organization?</h2>
<p>You can assign access roles to specific users in your organization, via the organization's <strong>Security</strong> page.</p>
<h4>To assign security roles to users</h4>
<ol>
	<li>In the Developer Portal, go to the Organizations List (see <a href="bus_admin_organizations.htm#proc_businesses_list">To access the Organizations List</a>).</li>
	<li>Find your organization on the list, and then click the title to view the <strong>Details</strong> page for the organization.</li>
	<li>On the left navigation bar, choose <strong>Security</strong>. In the right pane, the <strong>Role Memberships</strong> page, all roles currently available to the organization are displayed. An example is shown below.
<p><img src="assets/security_role_memberships_hermosa.jpg" alt="Security role memberships" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>On the list, find the role you want to assign, and click the <strong>Edit</strong> (pencil) icon to the right. The {role name} - Users page has two panes:
		<ul>
			<li>Left pane has a search bar to help you identify one or more users you want to assign the role to.</li>
			<li>Right pane lists users currently assigned to the role.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li>In the left pane, enter search criteria at the top, and then click <strong>Go</strong>, to locate users.</li>
	<li>To assign the user to the role, click <strong>Assign</strong>.</li>
	<li>When done, click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>

<h2 id="business_roles_default">What are the default roles for the API platform?</h2>
<p>In the developer portal, you can manage roles for the platform users who are part of your business organization, as explained in <a href="#business_assign_roles_to_users">How do I assign security roles to users for my organization?</a> above.</p>
<p>The summary below gives you the basic definition for each of the default roles. Note that your platform implementation might already include some customization of roles, in the underlying infrastructure. The definitions below are the defaults.</p>
<h4>Default roles</h4>

<dd><strong>Note</strong>: A user assigned the API Administrator role in the context of a business organization, who is not invited to a specific API, does not have permission to manage API Admins, such as adding or removing other API Admins.
