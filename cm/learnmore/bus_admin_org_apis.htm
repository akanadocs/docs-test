<h2 id="org_api_manage">How do I manage APIs for my business organization on the platform?</h2>
<p>In the API platform, providing you have sufficient permissions, you can add and manage APIs at the root level.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In Hermosa Theme: <strong>APIs</strong> &gt; <strong>Add API</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The platform also supports setting up a business organization. You can then add apps and APIs at the organization level. You have full rights to manage these APIs, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#org_api_add">Adding an API</a></li>
	<li><a href="#org_api_view">Viewing APIs</a></li>
	<li><a href="#org_api_modify">Modifying an API</a></li>
	<li><a href="#org_api_delete">Deleting an API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To perform activities relating to apps and APIs at the organization level, you must first log in, and then choose the organization. You can then view and manage resources that were set up at the organization level.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="org_api_add">How do I add an API to an organization on the API platform?</h2>
<p>Adding an API to a specific organization on the platform is essentially the same as adding an API at the root level. However, when you first specify an organization and then add the API within the context of the organization, the API visibility is limited to those who have visibility of the organization.</p>
<p>Only a Business Admin of the organization can add, modify, or delete APIs within the organization.</p>
<h4>To add an API for a business organization</h4>
<ol>
	<li>In the Community Manager developer portal, go to the Organizations List (see <a href="bus_admin_organizations.htm#proc_businesses_list">To access the Organizations List</a>).</li>
	<li>Find your organization on the list, and then click the title to view the <strong>Details</strong> page for the organization.</li>
	<li>In the left menu, click <strong>APIs</strong>. All APIs associated with the organization are displayed.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add</strong>. The <strong>Add API</strong> page displays.</li>
	<li>Add an API in the same way as you would at the root organization level. For detailed instructions, see <a href="apiadmin_api_add.htm">Adding an API</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="org_api_view">How do I view APIs for an organization on the API platform?</h2>
<p>If you're a Business Admin, you have full rights to add, view, edit, or delete APIs that are set up for your organization.</p>
<h4>To view APIs for an organization</h4>
<ol>

	<li>In the left menu, click <strong>APIs</strong>. All APIs currently set up for the organization are displayed. To view details of a specific API, click the link in the title.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="org_api_modify">How do I modify an API associated with an organization on the API platform?</h2>
<p>If you're a Business Admin, you have full rights to add, view, edit, or delete APIs that are set up for your organization.</p>
<h4>To modify an API associated with an organization</h4>

</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="org_api_change_parent">How do I move an API from one organization to another?</h2>
<p>You can move an API that's in the context of one of your organizations into another organization, as long as you are a Business Admin for both organizations. For example, you might have a billing department and a payments department, and create the billing API in the context of the payments department by mistake. You can easily move it. Follow the steps below.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you move an API, all versions of the API are moved.</p>

<h4 id="proc_org_api_change_parent">To move an API from one business organization to another</h4>
<ol>
	<li>In the Community Manager developer portal, go to the Organizations List (see <a href="bus_admin_organizations.htm#proc_businesses_list">To access the Organizations List</a>).</li>
	<li>Find the organization that the API currently exists under, and then click the title to view the <strong>Details</strong> page for the organization.</li>
	<li>On the left navigation bar, choose <strong>APIs</strong>. All APIs associated with the organization are displayed.</li>
	<li>Find the API that you want to move, and then click the title to view the API <strong>Overview</strong> page.</li>
	<li>On the left navigation bar, click Details to view the API <strong>Details</strong> page.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
	<li>On the right, in the <strong>Parent Organization Name</strong> field, start typing the name of the organization you want to move it to. After the first three characters, the platform displays a list of matching organizations for you to choose from.</li>
	<li>Click the entry for the new organization so that the full name is displayed in the field.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The API is moved to the new organization.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="org_api_delete">How do I delete an API associated with an organization on the API platform?</h2>
<p>If you're a Business Admin, you have full rights to add, view, edit, or delete APIs that are set up for your organization.</p>
<p>If you're deleting an API, you should first make sure there are no active app contracts associated with the API.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: If there are multiple versions for the API, you must delete each version. When you delete the final version, the API is deleted.</p>
<h4>To delete an API associated with an organization</h4>
<ol>
	<li>In the Community Manager developer portal, go to the Organizations List (see <a href="bus_admin_organizations.htm#proc_businesses_list">To access the Organizations List</a>).</li>
	<li>Find your organization on the list, and then click the title to view the <strong>Details</strong> page for the organization.</li>
	<li>In the left menu, click <strong>APIs</strong>. All APIs associated with the organization are displayed.</li>
	<li>Find the API on the list, and click the link in the title.</li>
	<li>In the left menu, click <strong>Details</strong> to access the API Designer summary page.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Delete Version</strong>. At the confirmation message, click <strong>OK</strong>. The API version is deleted. When the last version is deleted, the API is deleted.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="org_api_roles">What roles can manage APIs for my business organization on the platform?</h2>
<p>The Business Admin has full responsibility for all resources, such as apps and APIs, created at the organization level.</p>
<p>A user who has been assigned the API Administrator role by a Business Admin, in the context of a specific business organization, has full rights to view, add, modify, or delete APIs for the organization, but cannot view or manage API Admins (see <a href="bus_admin_org_roles.htm#business_roles_default">What are the default roles for the API platform?</a>). Only the user who created the business API, or was invited to the API Admin group for the business API, can manage API Admins for an API in the context of a business organization. See <a href="apiadmin_overview.htm#apiadmin_management_capabilities">What API management capabilities are available to the API Admin in the platform?</a></p>
<p>App developers on the platform can request access to APIs within a business organization if they have permission to do so.</p>
