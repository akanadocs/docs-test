<a name="how_do_i_obtain_a_quick_view_of_my_apis_performance"></a>
<h3>How can I see a quick view of my API's performance?</h3>
<p>The API &gt; <strong>Analytics</strong> &gt; <strong>Overview</strong> section includes a barometer-style Dashboard that gives you an overview of your API's performance. For example, it shows API throughput, latency, and errors for messages in real time for Sandbox and Live environments.</p>
<p>Statistics are calculated for all apps consuming your API, and for all operations that are part of your API. You can get statistics on a per-second or per-minute basis. The Analytics Dashboard displays statistics for the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>You can narrow down the data by the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implementation: Sandbox or Live</li>
  <li>Interval: Per Sec or Per Min</li>
</ul>
<p>The API Analytics Dashboard controls scale based on the number of messages received and the time interval selected (sec or min). For example, if your app sent or received 50 messages in the last 5 seconds, the scale changes to 0-60.</p>
<p>The API Analytics Dashboard provides the following control types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Throughput:</strong> Provides statistics on the rate of successful message delivery.</li>
  <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Provides statistics on the amount of time it takes to process a message from source to destination.</li>
  <li><strong>Errors:</strong> Provides statistics on the number errors incurred during message delivery.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can view data for <strong>Usage By App</strong>, <strong>Usage By Operation</strong>, and <strong>API Standings</strong>; you can also export the data. For more information, see:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#how_do_i_export_usage_data_for_apps_consuming_my_api">How do I export usage data for apps consuming my API?</a></li>

<a name="how_do_i_monitor_api_performance"></a><h3>How do I monitor API performance?</h3>
<p>Performance charts are included in the <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; app &gt; <strong>Analytics</strong> &gt; <strong>Charts</strong> page. Chart data can be used to monitor API usage over time or to troubleshoot errors.</p>
<p>The Performance Chart functionality allows you to view performance in Live or Sandbox implementations, and provides monitoring for tracking service response time and transaction faults. Charts are populated by usage &quot;roll-up&quot; data that is gathered during the processing of web service request and response messages. Historic usage and performance data can be queried and viewed in the Usage Logs section. See <a href="#how_do_i_monitor_api_usage_logs">How do I monitor API usage logs?</a></p>
<p>Performance Charts automatically scale the Y axis to show an appropriate range for the data shown. You can choose to scale to the average based on the selected interval (the default) or you can set your own scaling.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Updating of chart performance statistics using <strong>Refresh</strong> is based on the selected Duration and Interval, which together represent the total time range displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Chart Types</strong></p>
<p>The following performance chart types are supported for APIs. All chart data is presented in milliseconds (ms).</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Time Range</strong></p>
<p>The Performance Chart includes a navigation control, located at the bottom of the chart, which allows you to navigate the Timeline based on the selected Duration and Time Interval. Throughput data can also be monitored on the timeline and is presented in a spline chart.</p>
<p>After you have defined a timeline, there are several ways to view additional chart detail. The <strong>Zoom</strong> feature allows you to view chart data by clicking on a pre-defined interval (1 hour, 3 hour, 6 hour, 12 hour, All). The Data Point Popup allows you to hover over a specific datapoint to view response data detail including Date, Time, Average, Max, and Min.</p>
<p><strong>Chart Controls</strong></p>
<p>You can narrow down the information for the charts by setting the values listed below.</p>
<p>Graph Controls section of a Performance Chart
  provides options for configuring the chart content (a specific API or all APIs), data capture, and display intervals (Duration and Interval), as well as navigating and zooming the chart Timeline. Each chart displays data based on the currently approved environment (Sandbox or Live).</p>

</ul>
<p>From the API <strong>Details</strong> page, click <strong>Analytics</strong> on the left menu, and then click <strong>Licenses</strong>.</p>
<p>There are certain prerequisites that must be in place for monitoring information to be displayed correctly. Make sure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your API is using the Licenses feature.</li>
  <li>Your licenses include a quota policy.</li>
  <li>Your timezone is set correctly in the configuration settings for the underlying infrastructure (configuration settings, com.soa.rollup.configuration, monitoring.rollup.configuration.dailyRollupTimeZones setting). The timezone setting affects the way the data is rolled up into increments such as hour and day. If the settings are not correct, ask your Site Admin to adjust the timezone.</li>
</ul>
<p>The options available are summarized in the table below.</p>

<a name="how_do_i_monitor_my_apis_performance_per_license"></a><h3>How do I monitor my API's performance per license?</h3>
<p>The API monitoring feature allows you to review your API's activity with any apps that are using it, specific to any licenses offered for API usage.</p>
<h5>To monitor API performance for a specific license:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in and go to your API Details page.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Analytics</strong> &gt; <strong>Licenses</strong>.</li>
  <li>Choose values as needed. For details on the options available, refer to <a href="#monitoring_by_license_graph_controls">Analytics by License: Graph Controls</a> above.</li>
</ol>

<a name="how_do_i_monitor_my_apis_performance_per_contract"></a>
<h3>How do I monitor my API's performance for a specific app/API contract?</h3>
<p>You can view monitoring charts and logs for any specific contract your API has with an app, as long as monitoring is turned on for your API.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the specified time period includes a point where the contract was revised, or suspended and resumed, or the contract was cancelled and a new one created, the chart or graph shows <strong>all</strong> transaction info between the app and the API in the selected time period. However, only in the case where the contract was revised, there is uninterrupted service. In other scenarios, service is suspended or stopped and is then resumed or restarted, with a period in between where the contract is not active.</p>
<h5>To monitor API performance for a specific contract:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in and go to the API Details page for your API.</li>
  <li>On the left menu, click <strong>Analytics</strong>.</li>
  <li>Choose one of the following options, to view contract information in different ways:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Overview</strong>: Choose the environment. Here, in the <strong>Usage by App</strong> pie chart, you can see what portion of your API's total traffic is generated by a specific app.</li>
      <li><strong>Charts</strong>: Choose the environment and the app, and other values as needed. Here, you can view transaction volume, success/fault, and how the traffic measures against min/max average transaction time, if specified. You can also export the chart information.</li>
      <li><strong>Logs</strong>: Choose the environment and the app, and date range if needed. Here, you can view specific transaction logs. You can also export the log information.</li>
      <li><strong>Licenses</strong>: Choose the environment and the app, and other values as needed. Choose API Usage by App.</li>
