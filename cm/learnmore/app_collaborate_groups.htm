<a name="what_is_a_group"></a><h3>What is a Group?</h3>
<p>Group functionality provides a method of creating common interest groups around  specific APIs. The creator of a group is the Group Administrator. Member  invitations are sent and managed by the group Administrator or designated  group leaders. <em>Only Group  Administrators and designated group  leaders can create Groups.</em></p>
<p> After a  group  is established and members have accepted invitations, members can be promoted to a leader status. A leader is indicated on a  group member account with an orange <em>Leader</em> status. Leaders can send out additional invitations and manage memberships within their specific group. Group members can collaborate on the group <em>Board</em> that is only visible to group members. Group members can obtain a view-only summary of members in their group on the <em>Group Details</em> page.</p>
<p>Group members can provide feedback on the group by providing a Peer Rating that uses a  star rating system  to record positive feedback, or Peer Review where you can write and post a review about the group.</p>
<p>The platform supports both Independent and Private API Groups. See <a href="#what_types_of_groups_does_the_platform_support">What types of groups does the platform support?</a></p>
<p>Independent and Private API Groups have different access methods in the UI, but their  functionality  is essentially the same (except where noted). See <a href="#how_do_i_access_independent_or_private_api_groups">How do I access Independent or Private API Groups?</a> for access methods.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_types_of_groups_does_the_platform_support"></a><h3>What types of groups does the platform support?</h3>
<p>The platform supports the following group types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Independent Group</strong>&#8212;This group type allows you to create and manage special interest groups. You can set the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">visibility</a> of the group as Public, <strong>Registered Users</strong>, Private. Use the <strong>Add a New Group</strong> function via the <em>Plus</em> menu to create an independent group, or set the <strong>Do you want this group to be independently managed?</strong> option on the <strong>Add a New Group function</strong> in a Private API. For Private APIs the group will display via the My Groups Quick Filter and on the <em>APIs &gt; Groups</em> page.</li>
  <li><strong>Private API Group</strong>&#8212;This group type allows you to create and manage groups for APIs that are configured with private visibility. Use the <strong>Add a New Group</strong> function in the <em>My APIs &gt; API Name &gt; Groups</em> section to create a group for a Private API. See <a href="api_admin_api_publishing.htm#what_is_a_private_api">What is a Private API?</a> for more information. If you would like to create an independent group, set the <strong>Do you want this group to be independently managed?</strong> option to yes. This will set the Private API Group to Public and it will be accessible via the <em>My Groups</em> Quick Filter and on the <em>APIs &gt; Groups</em> page.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_are_the_components_of_the_groups_page"></a><h3>What are the components of the Groups page?</h3>
<p>The <em>APIs</em> section includes a <em>Groups</em> page that allows API Administrators to create Private API Groups and send out invitations to developers. Group members can also be promoted to a <em>Leader</em> status and send out invitations and manage memberships within their specific group.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Group</strong></p>
<p>API Administrators can create a group for the current API and send out invitations to developers to join the group. The first time you select <em>APIs &gt; Visibility &gt; Groups</em>, the <em>Groups</em> page  displays the &quot;This API does not have any groups&quot; message  along with the <strong> Create a Group</strong> button. After creating a group, you can select <strong>Invite More</strong> to send out invitations to developers to join the API group.</p>
<p><strong>Edit Group Info</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Edit Group Info</strong> function allows you to edit the Group Name, Description, and Federation Member.</p>
<p><strong>Invite More</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Invite More</strong> function allows API Administrators to send invitations to individuals that you would like to be part of your Private API Group.</p>
<p><em>Note that invitees must be  platform members to except an invitation. After sending the invitation, an invitation email is issued. The recipient (if already a platform member), can log into the platform and accept the invitation via their Dashboard. If the recipient is not currently a platform member, they must sign up, and then log in to accept the invitation via their Dashboard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Manage</strong></p>
<p>After sending out your first group invitation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The invitee receives a request in their <em>Dashboard</em>. Here the invitee can <strong>Accept</strong> or <strong>Decline</strong> the invitation.</li>
  <li>API Administrators can assign or unassign a member a  &quot;Leader&quot; role and Leaders can assign or unassign a member they have personally invited a &quot;Leader&quot; role.</li>
  <li>On the <em>Members</em> page, API Administrators or Leaders can view a summary of information for group members including username, email address, and  <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_invitationstatus">invitation status</a><strong>.</strong></li>
  <li>API Administrators or Leaders can reissue an invitation using the <strong>Resend</strong> function.</li>
  <li>API Administrators can remove a member and Leaders can remove a member they have personally invited.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Group Board</strong></p>
<p>The  <em>Group Board</em>  provides a collaboration tool where group members can discuss key topics and exchange ideas. The <em>Group Board</em> is available through the independent group interface only (i.e., <strong>Add a New Group</strong> from the <em>Plus</em> menu).</p>
<p><strong>Followers</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Followers</em> page  allows users to subscribe to groups  they are interested in by clicking the <strong>Follow</strong> button. Subscribing to a group allows users to receive   news or updates relating to the group on their personal <em>Dashboard</em>.</p>
