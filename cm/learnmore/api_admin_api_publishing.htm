<a name="what_is_the_difference_between_sandbox_and_live_environments"></a><h3>What is the difference between Sandbox and <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementations?</h3>
<p>Each implementation is configured by the API Admin; each has unique endpoints. A common scenario is outlined below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Sandbox endpoint is a unique gateway URL that provides access to the API's Sandbox implementation&#8212;generally used for testing. App developers must request access; in some cases, Sandbox access might be auto-approved.</li>
  <li>The <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementation is generally used for production traffic, for real transactions rather than testing. Often, the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementation has additional policies and security applied. However, the features of each endpoint are completely configurable.</li></ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_autoconnect"></a><h3>What is auto-connect?</h3>
<p>The platform's auto-connect feature allows an API Admin to set up the API so that when a new app is created on the platform, a contract with the API is created automatically. The API Admin specifies the details of the access granted with the auto-connect feature, such as whether access is to the Sandbox or <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> environment, or whether access is limited to specific operations or a specific transaction volume (via the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_license">Licenses</a> feature, implemented with <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_scopemapping">scope mapping</a>).</p>
<p>You can change the auto-connect details for your API at a later time; however, be aware that if contracts have already been created, those will continue unless you specifically end them.</p>
<p>If your API uses licenses, it's important to set up scope mapping for your API before setting up the auto-connect feature, since the auto-connect settings reference the scope mapping settings.</p>
<p>For instructions on setting up auto-connect for your API, see <a href="#how_do_i_set_up_autoconnect_for_my_api">How do I set up Auto-Connect for my API?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_set_up_autoconnect_for_my_api"></a><h3>How do I set up auto-connect for my API?</h3>
<p>If you want to grant new apps automatic access to your API, you'll want to set up the auto-connect feature.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: If your API is using licenses, set up scope mapping first. Then, follow the instructions below.</p>
<h5>To set up auto-connect for an API:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the <strong>Details</strong> page for the API.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Auto-Connect</strong> button.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Set Up Auto-Connect Settings</strong> page, check one or more boxes to indicate environment for auto-connect contracts: <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->, Sandbox, or both.</li>
  <li>Conditional: if your API uses the Licenses feature, a list of scopes is displayed for any environment you selected. Check one or more scopes that you want to allow for an auto-connect contract, for each environment selected.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_set_up_my_api_to_allow_anonymous_access"></a><h3>How do I set up my API to allow anonymous access?</h3>
<p>The platform supports app developers testing an API without choosing a specific app (anonymous context).</p>
<p>In order for developers to be able to test your API in this way, you must have some settings in place:</p>
<ul>
  <li>API setup, Proxy tab: <strong>Allow Anonymous Access</strong> is set to <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
  <li>API setup, Proxy tab: <strong>This API Requires Approval</strong> is set to <strong>No</strong>.</li>
  <li>API setup, Proxy tab: there are no security policies added to the API.</li>
  <li>API setup, API tab: if the API uses licenses, make sure the licenses do not use any private scopes.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="h_scopes_and_licenses"></a>Scopes and Licenses</h3>




<a name="how_do_i_determine_what_licenses_will_be_available_for_my_api"></a><h3>How do I determine what licenses will be available for my API?</h3>
<p>There are a couple of steps you'll need to complete in your API setup to define the licenses that app developers will see when requesting access to your API:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In your API setup, make sure that the Use Licenses box is checked. Go to the <em>API Details</em> page, click <strong>Edit</strong>, and verify that the box is checked.</li>
  <li>Map scopes to your API's licenses. From the <em>API Details</em> page, click <strong>Manage Licensing</strong>. For instructions, see <a href="#to_perform_scope_mapping">To perform scope mapping</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The scopes are the link between your API and the licenses that are offered to app developers. If you have any questions regarding which scopes to assign or which licenses will be available, consult your Business Admin.</p>
<p>For an overview of the Licenses feature and the relationship between the setup steps performed by the Business Admin and those done by the API Admin, and the relationship between scopes and licenses, see <a href="ov_licenses.htm">Licenses: Feature Overview</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_edit_the_license_on_an_api_access_request_api_administrator"></a><h3>How do I edit the license on an API access request?</h3>
<p>An API Administrator can change the license for a specific API Access Request prior to approving the request.</p>
<p>If you want to review the license scope of API access requests before approving, make sure you've selected the <strong>This API requires approval</strong> option in the API setup (<em>API</em> &gt; <em>Edit</em> &gt; <em>Proxy</em> page). If the API is set to auto-approve requests, you won't have the opportunity to modify the license.</p>
<h5>To edit the license scope for a pending API access request:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <em>APIs &gt; Apps</em>.</li>
  <li>Select the API Access Request you want to modify. It must have a status of <strong>Access Pending</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click<strong> Edit.</strong> The <em>API Access Wizard</em> launches and loads the <em>Licenses</em> page.</li>
  <li>Change the license option as needed.</li>
  <li>Click through the rest of the wizard and then click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_scope_mapping_and_how_do_i_set_it_up"></a><h3>What is scope mapping and how do I set it up?</h3>
<p>If your API is using the Licenses feature, scope mapping is the key to defining which portions of your API will be available for which licenses. The scopes and licenses themselves are defined by the Business Admin, but at the API level you determine which operations are assigned to which scopes. This in turn determines which licenses will be available to app developers requesting access to your API.</p>
<p>For example, let's say your API includes a set of operations relating to calendar functionality and another set of operations relating to email access and management. App A might only need access to the calendar functionality, and App B might include an email client and might require access to the operations relating to email. The scope mapping feature enables you to group individual operations into logical groups that can be separately packaged into a license for App A and another for App B.</p>
<p>As another example, let's say you want to offer access to your GET operations, and a higher level of access, for a fee, to all operations including add, modify, and delete. The Business Admin defines READ and MODIFY scopes, and then assigns each to a separate license. The API Admin assigns GET operations to the READ scope and assigns all operations to the MODIFY scope. Users who choose the paid license get access to all scopes; users who choose the free license can only access the GET operations.</p>
<p>At runtime, when a request is received to an API proxy from a particular app, the request is only passed through to the API if it is using one of the specific operations covered by the license governing the API contract.</p>
<!--<p><em>Note: If your API is configured with OAuth, the scopes were defined as part of the initial OAuth Provider configuration in the Site Administration section. The Edit OAuth Details function on the API Details page includes a <strong>Scope Mapping</strong> function for this scenario.</em></p>-->
<a name="to_perform_scope_mapping"></a><h5>To perform scope mapping:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>First, make sure the Licenses feature is enabled in the API. From the <em>API Details</em> page, click<strong> Edit</strong>, and make sure the <strong>Use Licenses</strong> check box is checked.</li>
  <li>From the <em>API Details</em> page, click <strong>Manage Licensing</strong>. The <em>Edit API Scope</em> page displays.</li>
  <li>Check the <strong>Enable Licensing for API</strong> box.</li>
  <li>Choose a scope mapping approach:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>API-Wide Mapping</strong>: choose this if you're not subdividing your operations for licensing purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Operation-Specific Mapping</strong>: choose this if you'll want to grant access to some portions of your API separately.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  
  <li>Operation-specific mapping only: For each operation, in the <em>Scope</em> column, click <strong>Select</strong>. The <em>Select Scope</em> popup displays. Choose one or more scopes for the operation and click <strong>Confirm</strong>. If you assign scopes to an operation, all apps with licenses that include one of those scopes can use the operation. If no scopes are defined for an operation, it means that no scopes are needed for that operation (the least secure scenario).</li>
  <li>Repeat for each operation.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<!--<h5>To configure Scope Mapping (via <em>Edit OAuth Details &gt; Scope Mapping</em>):</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Refer to the Configure Scope Mapping section in <a href="publish_api_oauth_support.htm#how_do_i_configure_my_api_with_an_oauth_provider">How do I configure my API with an OAuth Provider?</a></li>

<a name="how_do_i_inform_app_developers_about_available_licenses_and_app_access"></a><h3>How do I inform app developers about available licenses and API access?</h3>
<p>As a standard practice, a list of available Licenses and the level of App Access provided by each License should be included in the documentation for your API.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="i_want_to_exclude_an_operation"></a><h3>I want to exclude an operation so app developers can't use it. How do I do that?</h3>
<p>You might have one or more operations that are part of your API but you don't want to make them available for app developers. Perhaps they are still under development or being tested.</p>
<p>If you want to make sure no app can access these operations, the best way to do it is with scopes and licenses. You can use a scope that isn't assigned to any license, and use the API scope mapping wizard to assign that scope to the operation. When you're ready to share the operation, you can update the scope assignments, assigning a scope that's assigned to a license so that app developers can choose to access it.</p>

<h3><a name="h_api_visibility"></a>API Visibility</h3>




<a name="what_is_a_private_api"></a><h3>What is a private API?</h3>
<p>A private API is one that has a <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">visibility</a> setting such that it is visible only to platform users who are members of one or more groups that have been specifically invited to have visibility of the API.</p>
<p>In the platform, any API or other resource that is private is shown with a &quot;lock&quot; icon to indicate privacy.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_manage_api_visibility"></a><h3>How do I manage API visibility?</h3>
<p>When you create an API using the <strong>Create a New API</strong> function you can control <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">visibility</a> of the API. You can change API visibility based on your requirements by using the <strong>Edit</strong> function on the <em>API Details</em> page.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An API with a visibility of <strong>Public</strong>  is visible to all individuals, even anonymous users; it is searchable, and displays in the <em>All APIs</em> search filter.</li>
  <li>An API with a visibility of <strong>Registered User</strong> is visible to all individuals who are logged into the platform; it is searchable, and displays in the <em>All APIs</em> search filter.</li>
  <li>An API with a visibility of <strong>Public</strong> is visible to the creator, in the <em>My APIs</em> search filter, to all API Admins, and to individuals that are members of an API Context Group or of a group that is invited to have visibility of the API. The API name displays on the <em>API Details</em> page with a lock icon indicating that it is private.</li>

<a name="how_does_the_api_visibility_option_work"></a>
<h3>How does the API visibility option work?</h3>
<p>The <em>API &gt; Visibility</em> menu option allows API Administrators to control who can see the API and its associated resources such as documentation and downloadable files. The API Admin can invite groups to have visibility of the API resources. The following group visibility scenarios are supported:</p>

<a name="what_about_api_documentation_visibility"></a><h3>What about API documentation visibility?</h3>
<p>If your API has restricted visibility, users who don't have visibility of the API will not see your API documentation.</p>
<p>If your API uses licenses, users who have visibility of the API as a whole might not have access to certain operations, depending on the licenses they've selected. In this scenario, you'll need to apply special tags to your API documentation to make sure that users will see the documentation they have access to. By default, untagged API doc content is hidden.</p>
<p>For information on tagging your API documentation, including the different types of tags available, implementation suggestions, and examples, see <a href="api_admin_documentation_tagging.htm">API Documentation Tagging</a>.</p>
