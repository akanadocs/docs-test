<h3><a name="h_api_setup">API Setup</h3>




<a name="what_are_apis"></a><h3>What are APIs?</h3>
<p>APIs are business capabilities exposed over the internet for applications to use. Simply put, an API is a programming interface that your organization exposes over the internet that allows applications to communicate with your backend systems. Typically, you build APIs that expose specific aspects of business functionality. These are things that differentiate you in the market place and that make money for you and your company. So essentially what you are doing through the creation of APIs is creating a new channel for your business by exposing a set of capabilities for your product (services that people can build into mobile applications and sell to their customers), thereby creating a channel for your products and services online.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_are_the_recommended_api_development_best_practices"></a><h3>What are the recommended API development best practices?</h3>
<p>Developing an API includes these key phases: Plan, Build, Run, and Promote.</p>
<p><strong>Planning:</strong></p>
<p>The planning phase involves determining which APIs to publish. Key considerations when selecting APIs include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Is the API well defined and well scoped?</li>
  <li>Does the API deliver a clear business value?</li>
  <li>Does the API highlight and showcase your differentiators as a company?</li>
  <li>Does the API offer your potential consumer with a clear business value and reason for using it?</li>
  <li>Does the API offer cost benefits or functionality over potential competitors?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Build:</strong></p>
<p>After the API has been planned, approved and appropriately scoped, the next step is to build it. Jet considerations when building an API:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Is the API atomic and well documented?
<p>Building an API that is simple, easy to understand, and well documented will encourage developers to use it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Run</strong>:</p>
<p>After the API is built, the next step is to run it. Key considerations when running an API include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the API secure?
<p>The API must be robust and managed. To achieve this you must provide developers with feedback that the API will perform reliably in terms of functionality, performance, and its ability to security the customer data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Promote:</strong></p>
<p>Once the API is running you must promote it. Key considerations when promoting an API include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How can you as an organization create a market  for the API?
<p><em>Collaborate</em>&#8212;To market your API to a set of consumers (developers writing apps) you must create a community around your API. Creating a community of partners provides a value add to your services and your APIs and allows developers to collaborate with each other. This can be accomplished in the platform using the <em>API Group</em> and <em>API Board</em> functions.</p>
<p><em>Search</em>&#8212;Users need to be able to  effectively find your APIs, you need to get access to  the documentation and  collaborate around  developing their applications. This can be accomplished in the platform using the <em>Search</em> function where users can perform a free text search or use a pre-defined search filter.</p>
<p><em>Support</em>&#8212;You must support the API effectively. As you write your APIs you may run into problems and would like gain expertise and advice from community members. This can be accomplished in the platform using the <em>API Board</em>, trouble ticket management system, and by <a href="basics_support.htm#how_do_i_contact_technical_support">submitting a support request</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_the_minimum_requirement_for_adding_an_api"></a><h3>What is the minimum requirement for adding an API?</h3>
<p>The minimum requirement to add an API to the platform is that it must have an endpoint. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your   API could be  in the design phase and you may want to publish it so you can use the <em>API Board</em> to collaborate with developers on requirements and design. In this scenario you could use any endpoint to facilitate usage of the platform features until the API development is complete.</li>
  <li>When your API is ready for use in  sandbox or production environments, it  must have a valid endpoint so that applications can request load access to it.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_security_and_monitoring_policies_are_supported"></a><h3>What security and monitoring policies are supported?</h3>
<p>The platform allows you to secure and monitor your APIs with the following  pre-configured policies. These policies are selected by default and should  be assigned to   newly created APIs. Three policy categories are supported:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple Header Security</strong>&#8212;Used to identify (authenticate) the application that is attempting to consume an API to determine if it is authorized or not.&nbsp;This policy type supports multiple mechanisms for the App to present its identity, including plain text App Id, signed header with X.509 or a shared secret, or OAuth (1.0a or 2.0).</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring</strong>&#8212;Collects transaction details including recorded messages for every transaction.</li>
  <li><strong>OAuth</strong>&#8212;Provides support for applications performing authentication and authorization using OAuth.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you add an API using the <strong>Add a New API Wizard</strong>, in the <em>Policies</em> section on the <em>Proxy</em> page, you MUST select one security policy (for example, Category: Simple Header  Security) and you should select a monitoring policy if you want to see charts  and logs.</p>
<p>If there are no policies available for selection, consult your Site Admin.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_add_an_api"></a><h3>How do I add an API?</h3>
<p>Your ability to add an API, and the choices available to you, vary according to the configuration settings for the specific instance of the platform you are using.</p>
<p>If you have the applicable permission, you can add an API. Click the  <em>Plus Menu</em> (the <strong>+</strong> icon at the top of the page) and choose Add a New API. For additional instructions, see <a href="#how_do_i_add_a_new_api">How do I add a new API (API with New Service)?</a> below.</p>
<p>In some cases, your version of the platform might be configured to allow you to either add an API by defining a new service, (SOAP-based or REST-based), or add an API for a service that's already defined in the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_api_gateway">API Gateway</a>.</p>
<p>If this is your scenario&#8212;from the <em>Plus Menu</em> (the <strong>+</strong> icon at the top of the page), select <strong>Add a New API</strong> and you will see the <strong>Select Type of API</strong> overlay. Choose one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>API with New Service</strong>: use this option for any API that isn't already set up as a service in <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_api_gateway">the API Gateway</a>, or if you don't need to take advantage of the additional options offered by the API Gateway. For additional information and instructions, see <a href="#how_do_i_add_a_new_api">How do I add a new API (API with New Service)?</a> below.</li>
  <li><strong>API with Existing Service</strong>: use this option when the service is already defined in the API Gateway console, or if you want to create the service using the flexible service definition model offered by the API Gateway. For more information, see <a href="#how_do_i_add_an_api_from_a_policy_manager_service">How do I add an API from an existing API Gateway service (API with Existing Service)?</a> below.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the above options are not available to you and you feel they should be, contact your Site Admin for assistance.</p>
<p>Once the basic API setup is done, there are several other important steps you might need to complete, depending on the nature of your API:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting up OAuth details for the API, if applicable. See See <a href="api_admin_oauth_support.htm#how_do_i_configure_my_api_with_an_oauth_provider">How do I configure my API with an OAuth Provider?</a></li>
  <li>Scope mapping, if your API is using licenses. <a href="#what_is_scope_mapping_and_how_do_i_set_it_up">What is scope mapping and how do I set it up?</a></li>
  <li>Setting up auto-connect. See <a href="#how_do_i_set_up_autoconnect_for_my_api">How do I set up Auto-Connect for my API?</a> Note: If your API uses licenses, be sure to set up scope mapping before setting up auto-connect.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_add_a_new_api"></a>
<h3>How do I add a new API (API with New Service)?</h3>
<p>The platform provides an<strong> Add a New API</strong> function that allows you to add a <em>SOAP</em> or <em>REST</em>-based API. APIs can be added for both Sandbox and Production environments.</p>
<p>Note: If you want to add an API from a service already defined in the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_api_gateway">API Gateway</a>, use the <strong>Add API from Service</strong> option (if available) instead of Add a New API. For more information, see <a href="#how_do_i_add_an_api_from_a_policy_manager_service">How do I add an API from an existing API Gateway service (API with Existing Service)?</a> below.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Have your API documentation and legal agreements ready to upload before publishing your API.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Add APIs Wizard</em> includes the following sections:</p>
<p><strong>API</strong></p>
<p>On the <em>API</em> page you perform the initial step of specifying an API Name, Version ID, Tags, <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">Visibility</a>, API Description, Version Description, and API Icon. This information is displayed on your public API page and in the API search results.</p>
<p>A platform user who performs a search and finds your public API page, sees the API description and can rate and write and review your API. Individuals can also participate in a Yes/No survey indicating whether a review was useful or not. Based on this high visibility it's important that your API description is highly informative and includes the necessary marketing, functional, and use case information that will engage customers to request access to your API.</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong></p>
<p>On the <em>Target</em> page, you can configure SOAP-based APIs by specifying the SOAP version and WSDL. REST-based APIs are configured by specifying one or more operations. Policy selection is not required for the Target URL.</p>
<p><strong>Proxy</strong></p>
<p>The Proxy API page allows you to configure your API's proxy settings. If you would like to proxy your API, select the <strong>Yes</strong> radio button in the <em>Proxy API</em> section.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to proxying your API including utilizing platform security and service-level policies, monitoring performance, and allowing App Developers to gain access to your API sandbox endpoint (to test API functionality in their app), and production endpoint (to use API functionality in a live application). The Allow Anonymous Access option allows you to enable <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_anonymoususer">anonymous</a> access to an API endpoint if you would like to offer a preview of an API to developers without requiring users to create an app or sign up to the platform. For more information, see <a href="#what_is_anonymous_api_access">What is anonymous API access?</a></p>
<h5>To add a new API:</h5>
<p><strong>A. Launch the Add a New API Wizard</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>From the <em>Plus Menu</em>, select <strong>Add a New API</strong>. The <strong>Select Type of API </strong>overlay appears.</li>
  <li>Choose <strong>API with New Service</strong> and click <strong>Create</strong>. The <em>Add API Wizard</em> displays at the first page.
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: In some implementations, only a Business Administrator can add an API. If the option to add an API is not available to you and you feel it should be, contact your Administrator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>B. Specify API General Information</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>On the <em>API</em> page, specify the API Name, Version ID, Tags, <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">Visibility</a>, API Description, Version Description, and API Icon for the API. All the information you specify here displays on your customer-facing <em>API Details</em> page.
    <ul>
      <li>For information on Public and Private APIs, see <a href="#how_do_i_manage_api_visibility">How do I manage API visibility?</a></li>
      <li>For details on setting up your API avatar, see <a href="basics_account_management.htm#how_do_i_upload_and_crop_icons">How do I upload and crop icons?</a></li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Define whether the API will use licenses. C<strong>lick the Use Licenses</strong> checkbox to enable the licenses feature, including scope mapping. For more information, see <a href="#what_is_scope_mapping_and_how_do_i_set_it_up">What is scope mapping and how do I set it up?</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>C. Specify Target URL and Environment</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>After specifying the API information, click <strong>Next</strong> to continue. The <em>Target</em> page displays. Here you will specify <em>Target URL</em>, select the <em>Environment</em>, and configure <em>Advanced Options</em> for your API.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Target</em> section, specify the Target URL (target endpoint) of the API implementation. If you would like to specify additional Target URLs, click <strong>Add URL</strong>. For example, you might add one URL for a Sandbox Environment and another for a Production Environment.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Environment</em> section, click the radio button of the environment (Production or Sandbox) the Target URL is associated with.</li>
  <li>See <a href="#what_is_the_difference_between_sandbox_and_production_environments">What is the difference between Sandbox and Production environments?</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>See the <em>Configure Advanced Options</em> section.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>D. Configure Advanced Options</strong></p>
<p>By default, the REST protocol is selected for your API, a Default Profile (Any in and out), and Default Operation are specified. After specifying the Target URL and Environment, you can optionally update the existing protocol (REST), or change the protocol to SOAP in the <em>Advanced Options</em> section.</p>
<p><strong><em>Configure Protocol: </em></strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>On the <em>Advanced Options </em>line click <strong>Show</strong> to expand the section.</li>
</ol>


<h5>To configure a SOAP API:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Click the <strong>SOAP</strong> radio button. You can enter a WSDL URL directly or upload a zip archive:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>WSDL URL</strong>&#8212;Click the <strong>WSDL URL</strong> radio button, enter the WSDL URL and click <strong>Get</strong>. The operations load into the <em>Operations</em> section.</li>
      <li><strong>Zip Archive</strong>&#8212;Click the<strong> Zip Archive</strong> radio button, then click <strong>Browse</strong> and select your zip archive. Click <strong>Upload</strong>. The <em>Upload File</em> dialog displays <em>Select a WSDL File from the Archive</em> and presents a listing of WSDL files that can be selected. Click the radio button of the WSDL file you would like to upload. Click <strong>Select</strong>. The operations load into the <em>Operations</em> section.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h5><a name="to_configure_a_rest_based_api"></a>To configure a REST-based API:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Click the <strong>REST</strong> radio button and select a <em>Default Profile</em> from the drop-down menu. <strong>Any in and out </strong>is the default selection. For more information about the default profile, see <a href="#what_is_a_default_profile_for_a_rest_api">What is a Default Profile for a REST API?</a> below.</li>
  <li>A placeholder value, Default_Operation, is available for you to define the first operation. Modify it as needed, specifying these values:
    <ul>
      <li>Method (HTTP verb)</li>
      <li>Path</li>
      <li>Operation Name</li>
      <li>Settings</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  
  <li>To add another operation, click <strong>+Add </strong> and specify the values as needed. Specify content-type for the request and response if they are not the same as the default profile. To define a custom content-type, see <a href="#how_do_i_define_a_custom_content_type_for_a_rest_api">How do I define a custom content-type for a REST API?</a><br />
    <br />
    For the typical REST service, the most common methods, URIs, and serialization types would be:<br />

  <li>Click the <strong>Use HTTP 1.0</strong> checkbox if you need to force the HTTP version to 1.0 for the Target API. It is unlikely to be needed.</li>
  </ol>
<p><a name="configure_proxy"></a><strong>E. Configure Proxy</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>After specifying the Target information, click <strong>Next</strong> to continue. The <em>Proxy</em> page displays. Here you will specify the <em>Published URL</em> that represents what users will select when accessing your API. The page displays a summary list of all Production and Sandbox endpoints specified in the previous step. It's recommended that you use a Proxy API to take advantage of important platform functionality. See <a href="#what_is_a_proxy_api">What is a Proxy API?</a> for more information.<br />
    <em><br />
      Note:
      As a security measure, users will be able to access a proxy that will run in the Cloud, and access the API implementation directly. </em><br />
</li>
  <li>The <em>Advanced Options</em> section displays the settings configured in the <em>Target</em> section. If you would like the Proxy configuration to be different than you initially specified in the <em>Target</em> section, you can update the existing settings. <br />
    <br />
    For example, you might have two APIs that have the same <em>Target</em> information, but different <em>Proxy</em> information. Alternatively, you  might have a SOAP API implementation but want to offer developers a REST API implementation, in this case, the <em>Target</em> would be SOAP, and the <em>Proxy</em> would be REST.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>F. Enable / Disable Proxy API</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the <em>Proxy API </em>section, click a<strong> </strong>radio button to indicate whether you would like to proxy your API.
    <ul>
      <li>If you select <strong>No</strong>, click <strong>Save</strong> to complete the API configuration process.</li>
      <li>If you select <strong>Yes</strong>, proceed and configure the <em>Production Endpoint </em>and <em>Advanced Options</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>
<p><strong>G. Configure Production Endpoint (Proxy)</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the <em>Production Endpoint</em> section, configure the proxy information for each Sandbox or Production endpoint.
    <ul>
      <li>In the <strong>URL</strong> section, specify the protocol. When the system proxies the API, the URL is made up of a selected protocol and hostname in the first field plus the path in the second field. You do not need to specify a path. The default URL shown in this field is constructed from the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_deploymentzone">deployment zones</a> loaded in the platform or, if no deployment zones were loaded, based on Network Director instances configured in the organization path from the root to the tenant organization.</li>
      <li>For <strong>Allow Anonymous Access</strong>, click the <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong> radio button to indicate whether you would like to enable or disable <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_anonymoususer">anonymous</a> access for this API. See <a href="#what_is_anonymous_api_access">What is Anonymous API Access?</a> for more information.</li>
      <li>For <strong>This API requires Approval</strong>, indicate whether you would like to approve API access requests made with the <strong>API Access Wizard</strong>. All API Access Requests can be monitored by API Providers and designated administrators in the <em>API Name &gt; Apps</em> section.</li>
      <li>If you select <strong>Yes</strong>, proceed and configure the <em>Production Endpoint </em>and <em>Advanced Options</em>.</li>
      <li><em>Its common practice for Sandbox endpoint requests to be auto-approved. Production endpoint requests usually go through an approval cycle as API developers may want to review the app requesting access to see how the API functionality is being used.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Enter the <strong>CNAME</strong>. This represents the host name that is assigned to the proxy that is visible to individuals viewing your API. The API Provider is responsible for mapping the Host Name of the IP Address to the applicable DNS.
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: There are some headers that need to be set up in the underlying infrastructure, if your implementation uses load balancing, so that messages will be passed correctly. This is a Site Admin task. Full information is in the Site Admin help (<em>How do I set up and configure an OAuth Provider domain?</em>).</p></li>
  </ol>
<p><strong>H. Configure Advanced Options</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>On the <em>Advanced Options </em>line click <strong>Show</strong> to expand the section.</li>
  <li>The <em>Advanced Options</em> section allows you to select a protocol for the Proxy API, select policies, and select a Default Profile (REST option only). It displays the settings configured in the <em>Target</em> section.</li>
  <li>If you would like the Proxy configuration to be different than you initially specified in the <em>Target</em> section, you can update the existing settings. For example, you might have two APIs that have the same <em>Target</em> information, but different <em>Proxy</em> information. Alternatively, you might have a SOAP API implementation but want to offer developers a REST API implementation, in this case, the <em>Target</em> would be SOAP, and the <em>Proxy</em> would be REST. <br />
    <br />
    If the path in the proxy is different from that in the target, it is shown as &quot;Path not synced with target.&quot; If the Proxy configuration is different by design (as noted in the explanation above), do not resync. If you intend for the Proxy information to match the Target, go to the Target definition and click <strong>Sync to Proxy.</strong><br />
    <br />
    <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>If you need to add new operations, add them on the Target page first, then continue your configuration on the Proxy page.</em><br />
</li>
</ol>
<strong><em>Select Default Profile:</em></strong><br />
<br />
<ol>
  <li>Select a Default Profile from the drop-down list box. See <a href="#what_is_an_api_type_profile">What is an API Type Profile?</a> for more information.</li>
</ol>
<strong><em>Configure Method, Path, and Content Type for Operations:</em></strong><br />
<ol>
  <li>Select a Method from the dropdown menu, specify a URL in the text box, and configure a Content Type for the Request and Response message of each operation.</li>
  <li>See <a href="#what_are_the_supported_methods_and_content_types_for_requests">What are the supported Methods and Content Types for Requests?</a> for more information.</li>
</ol>
<strong><em>Select Policies:</em></strong>
<ol>
<li>In the <em>Policies</em> section, select the policies that you would like the system to enforce on the proxy.
  Note: <em>You MUST select one security policy (for example, Category: Simple Header Security) and you should select a monitoring policy if you want to see charts and logs. If no policies display, consult your API Provider or Site Administrator. </em>See <a href="#what_security_and_monitoring_policies_are_supported">What security and monitoring policies are supported?</a></li>
 <li>Also note that if you select a monitoring policy<em>, </em>app data is not supported in <em>My APIs &gt; Monitoring</em> if Anonymous API Access is enabled. See <a href="#what_is_anonymous_api_access">What is Anonymous API Access?</a> for more information.</li>
 <li>If your API will be supporting OAuth, it's best to use the <strong>Edit</strong> function on the <em>API Details</em> page to select the OAuthSecurity policy after you have configured the API to support OAuth (i.e., adding an OAuth Provider in the <em>Site Admin &gt; Domains</em> section), and configuring the API using the <strong>OAuth Details</strong> function on the <em>API Details</em> page.</li>
 <li>After making your changes click <strong>Save</strong>. Your API is now registered.</li>
 <li>If you will be configuring your API with OAuth, review the information in the <em>OAuth Support </em>section to determine next steps.</li>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_anonymous_api_access"></a><h3>What is anonymous API access?</h3>
<p>The Add API Wizard includes an Allow Anonymous Access option on the Proxy page that allows you to enable or disable anonymous access to Sandbox and Production endpoints.</p>
<p>Allowing anonymous access to an API endpoint in the Sandbox environment is useful if you would like to offer a preview of an API to developers without requiring users to create an app or sign up to the platform. For example, if you have a specific feature set you would like to expose as part of promoting your API, you can expose those operations in your API configuration, and enable the Proxy API and the Allow Anonymous Access option.</p>
<p>Developers can read the documentation and access the API without signing up and requesting access to the API. If a developer tries out the API and likes it, he/she can then sign up to the platform, create an app using the <strong>Add a New App</strong> function, and <a href="app_access_apis_api_access.htm#how_do_i_get_api_access_for_my_app">submit an API Access Request</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: Anonymous access is typically granted to API Sandbox endpoints, but it is generally not a standard practice to grant anonymous access to Production endpoints.</em></p>
<p>When you enable anonymous access in the <strong>Add a New API Wizard</strong> by selecting <strong>Yes</strong> to <strong>Allow Anonymous Access</strong> on the <em>Proxy</em> page, the <strong>This API Requires Approval</strong> option is disabled. This means that app developers are not required to submit an API Access Request to access the API, except in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An approved API Access Request is required before you can view the <em>Apps Connected</em> list on the <em>API Details</em> page.</li>
  <li>The <em>My Apps &gt; Dev Console</em> will only show the API from the API drop-down when an approved API Access Request exists.</li>
 </ul>
 <p><strong>API Charts / Logs with Anonymous API Access:</strong></p>
 <ul>
  <li>When <strong>Allow Anonymous Access</strong> is set to <strong>Yes</strong> for an API, viewing usage data for apps in the <em>Overview</em>, <em>Charts</em>, and <em>Logs</em> sections of <em>My APIs &gt; Monitor</em> is not supported. This applies whether or not an approved API Access Request exists for an app. The <em>My APIs &gt; Monitor</em> section will still show API usage data.</li>
 </ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_a_private_api"></a><h3>What is a private API?</h3>
<p>A private API is one that has a <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">visibility</a> setting such that it is visible only to platform users who are members of one or more groups that have been specifically invited to have visibility of the API.</p>
<p>In the platform, any API or other resource that is private is shown with a &quot;lock&quot; icon to indicate privacy. </p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_manage_api_visibility"></a><h3>How do I manage API visibility?</h3>
<p>When you create an API using the <strong>Create a New API</strong> function you can control <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">visibility</a> of the API. You can change API visibility based on your requirements by using the <strong>Edit</strong> function on the <em>API Details</em> page.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An API with a visibility of <strong>Public</strong>  is visible to all individuals, even anonymous users; it is searchable, and displays in the <em>All APIs</em> search filter.</li>
  <li>An API with a visibility of <strong>Registered User</strong> is visible to all individuals who are logged into the platform; it is searchable, and displays in the <em>All APIs</em> search filter.</li>
  <li>An API with a visibility of <strong>Public</strong> is visible to the creator, in the <em>My APIs</em> search filter, to all API Admins, and to individuals that are members of a Private API Group or of a group that is invited to have visibility of the API. The API name displays on the <em>API Details</em> page with a lock icon indicating that it is private.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_a_proxy_api"></a><h3>What is a proxy API?</h3>
<p>When you set up your API on the platform, using the platform as a proxy, your API is the Target API and the platform is the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_proxyapi">Proxy API</a>. This allows you to configure an endpoint in a particular environment (for example, internal or external network) that is accessible by your target applications.</p>
<p>A proxy API endpoint exists in the Cloud and is similar to a virtual service. As a security measure, users access the proxy that runs in the Cloud, rather than accessing the API implementation directly. Traffic is channeled via the proxy to your target API.</p>
<p>Based on the development cycle of your API, you can chose to expose selected functionality in your API by defining a Proxy API for each endpoint and selecting which functionality (for example, operations) you would like to expose. This approach allows you to manage the API lifecycle and expose functionality based on your requirements (for example, development phase, testing, production, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<p><em>Internal / External Networks</em>&#8212;If you would like to access to your real API on an internal network, but would like to expose specific functionality on an external network, you can add the API Target URL using the <strong>Add a New API </strong>function, and then virtualize the API by specifying a Proxy API Target URL for specific functionality you would like to make available on an external network.</p>
<p><em>Bridge Between App and Proxy API</em>&#8212;If your API is focused on the business aspects of the API or service, you can set up the proxy API to provide other tasks such as security enforcement or specifications required by the target (for example, API specs for the app team).</p>
<p><em>Sandbox / Production Endpoint Access</em>&#8212;Adding a Proxy API allows app developers to gain access to your API sandbox endpoint (to test API functionality in their app), and production endpoint (to use API functionality in a live application).</p>
<p><em>Contract Enforcement</em>&#8212;If you configure your API with a proxy, you can take advantage of the platform's contract enforcement functionality. Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When you add an API to the platform your policy administrator adds a series of security policies to the Tenant Organization for your platform using the SOA Software Policy Manager Console. Site or Policy Administrators can refer to the Community Manager Installation Guide for more information. <a href="basics_support.htm#how_do_i_contact_technical_support">Email Technical Support</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>In the platform, apps that would like to have access to your API submit and <strong>API Access Request</strong>.</li>
  <li>When the request is approved, the app is &quot;connected&quot; to the API.</li>
  <li>The security policies are in force when the app is connected to the API and ensure that only authorized applications can gain access to your API at runtime.</li>
  <li><em>Note if your API is not configured with a proxy, you will need to provide your own firewall rules and security approach to restrict applications making calls to your API.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Service-Level Policies </em>&#8212;If you configure your API with a proxy, you can take advantage of the service level and quota management policy functionality to monitor your API to ensure it meets the defined standards of service level performance contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Example Scenarios:</strong></p>
<p><em>Scenario 1</em>&#8212;You build an API and would like to expose specific functionality for the purposes of collaborating with a selected development and/or discussion group. You do not want to the API to be visible to anyone outside the selected group. To accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a new API, configure with private visibility, and add a proxy API for operations you would like to expose. For more information, refer to the <a href="api_admin_tutorial.htm">quick start for API Providers</a>.</li>
  <li>App developers can submit an API access request and connect to your API. See <a href="app_access_apis_api_access.htm#how_do_i_get_api_access_for_my_app">How do I get API access for my app?</a></li>
  <li>Create a Private API Group and invite selected individuals you would like to be part of your collaboration group<em>.</em> See <a href="app_collaborate_groups.htm">Groups</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>Update the API definition and adjust the configuration based on your business requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Scenario 2</em>&#8212;You build an API and would like to expose specific functionality to the public for them to use in their applications. To accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a new API, configure with public visibility, and add a proxy API for operations you would like to expose. Your API will be visible via the <em>Search</em> function. See the <a href="api_admin_tutorial.htm">quick start</a> for API Providers for more information.</li>
  <li>App developers can submit an API access request and connect to your API. See <a href="app_access_apis_api_access.htm#how_do_i_get_api_access_for_my_app">How do I get API access for my app?</a></li>
  <li>Create an Independent Group and invite individuals you would like to be part of your collaboration group<em>.</em> See <a href="app_collaborate_groups.htm">Groups</a> for more information.</li>

<a name="what_is_the_difference_between_sandbox_and_production_environments"></a><h3>What is the difference between sandbox and production environments?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sandbox is a unique gateway URL (service endpoint) that provides access to an API's sandbox environment where you perform testing. The Sandbox Endpoint URL becomes available after requesting access to an API using the <strong>Request API Access Wizard</strong>.</li>
  <li>Production is a unique gateway URL (service endpoint) that provides access to the production endpoint of an API. The production endpoint URL becomes available when you a) request production access, and b) go live after production access has been approved.</li></ul>

<a name="what_is_an_api_type_profile"></a><h3>What is an API Type Profile?</h3>
<p>An &quot;API Type Profile&quot; is used for proxy APIs to identify the type of content an API will accept from the consumer (IN), and will be returned by the API to the consumer (OUT). IN and OUT identifiers are combined with content types (i.e., ANY, JSON, FORM, and XML) and are packaged on the API Type Profile drop-down menu in profile sets. The following content types are supported:</p>

<a name="what_is_a_default_profile_for_a_rest_api"></a><h3>What is a Default Profile for a REST API?</h3>
<p>When you're defining a REST API in the platform, the basic API definition includes a default profile. This determines the content-type for request and response that will be used if you don't specific anything different. It's just a default for timesaving purposes.  For example, if 80% of your operations send and receive JSON content, you can choose<strong> JSON in and out</strong>. The default is <strong>Any in and out</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you've specified the most common scenario as the default profile, you can go ahead and specify content-type for any operations that have different values, by selecting from the list of available content-types. To view the list, click the <strong>Show</strong> link at the far right of the Default_Operation line, in the <strong>Settings</strong> column.</p>
<p>You can also specify a custom content-type. See <a href="#how_do_i_define_a_custom_content_type_for_a_rest_api">How do I define a custom content-type for a REST API?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_define_a_custom_content_type_for_a_rest_api"></a><h3>How do I define a custom content-type for a REST API?</h3>
<p>When you're adding or editing the API definition for a REST API, you have three choices with regard to defining the content-type for request and response messages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Specify a default that will apply to the majority of your operations. See <a href="#what_is_a_default_profile_for_a_rest_api">What is a Default Profile for a REST API?</a> above.</li>
  <li>Specify content-type individually for any operation that is different from the default, by choosing from the list of common content-types provided.</li>
  <li>Specify a custom content-type. See below.</li>
</ul>
<h5>To specify a custom content-type:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Follow the instructions in <a href="#to_configure_a_rest_based_api">To configure a REST-based API</a> until you get to Step 3.</li>
  <li>In the Settings column at the far right of the line for the operation, click the <strong>Show</strong> link. You will see the list of media types available for both request and response.</li>
  <li>In the Request column, clear the <strong>API Default</strong> box, and then click <strong>Custom</strong>. A new field appears for you to define the custom content-type.</li>
  <li>Specify the value. Make sure it's a valid media type with correct syntax.</li>
  <li>Continue setting up your API, specifying a custom media type for other operations as needed, and then click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the <strong>Proxy</strong> page.</li>

<a name="what_is_autoconnect"></a><h3>What is auto-connect?</h3>
<p>The platform's auto-connect feature allows an API Admin to set up the API so that when a new app is created on the platform, a contract with the API is created automatically. The API Admin specifies the details of the access granted with the auto-connect feature, such as whether access is to the sandbox or production environment, or whether access is limited to specific operations or a specific transaction volume (via the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_license">Licenses</a> feature, implemented with <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_scopemapping">scope mapping</a>).</p>
<p>You can change the auto-connect details for your API at a later time; however, be aware that if contracts have already been created, those will continue unless you specifically end them.</p>
<p>If your API uses licenses, it's important to set up scope mapping for your API before setting up the auto-connect feature, since the auto-connect settings reference the scope mapping settings.</p>
<p>For instructions on setting up auto-connect for your API, see <a href="#how_do_i_set_up_autoconnect_for_my_api">How do I set up Auto-Connect for my API?</a> below.</p>

<a name="how_do_i_export_an_api"></a><h3>How do I export an API?</h3>
<p>You can export information about an API to an external file. You can then import that file to another instance of the platform. One use of this feature is to move data from one environment to another, such as from a development environment to a testing or production environment.</p>
<p>You can also choose whether or not to export additional data associated with the API, such as policies, contracts, scopes, and documentation.</p>
<h5>To export an API:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the API Admin.</li>
  <li>Select <em>My APIs &gt; API Name</em>. The <em>API Details</em> page displays.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the Export overlay, choose the versions you want to export (Current or All) and the options. If you want to export all information about the API, check all boxes. You can export the following data associated with the API:
    <ul>
    <li>Export Operational Policies</li>
    <li>Export QoS Policies</li>
    <li>Export API PKI</li>
    <li>Export API Administrators<br />
      <strong>Note</strong>: the relationship of the user as an API admin is exported, but the user is not exported. The user must exist in the target environment. If the user does not exist when the information is imported, the API is created without that admin. From there, either a) the user can sign up and be invited to be an admin, b) the user can sign up and the API data can be reimported, c) another individual can be designated as an API admin.</li>

<p>The file has a very specific structure. It will look something like the image below:</p>
<p><img src="images/export_file_api.jpg" alt="File structure for an API export file" /></p>
<p>The export file will generally include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Files at root level: 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>objectgraph.xml</strong>: An XML file that shows the relationships between resources.</li>
      <li><strong>objectdata.xml</strong>: An XML-based  summary of all the data in the export file.</li>
      <li><strong>exportproperties.properties</strong>: a properties file showing which options were included in the export file.</li>

  </li>
  <li><strong>bpels</strong>: a folder containing XML business process files (<a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_bpel_file">bpel files</a>). One for each operation, for each environment. So, for example, if the API has five operations, and runs in Sandbox and Production environments, there are 10 bpel files.</li>
  <li><strong>services</strong>: a folder containing a subfolder for each environment, each subfolder containing a bpel.xml file for the applicable service/environment.</li>

<h3>How do I import an API from an export file?</h3>
<p>Once you've exported an API to an external zip file, it can be imported to another environment. For example, you can export from a development environment and then import to a testing or production environment.</p>
<p>The Business Admin can export information about an API to an external file. However, only a Site Admin or Business Admin can import.</p>
<p>If you need help with import functions, contact your Administrator.</p>

<a name="how_do_i_determine_what_licenses_will_be_available_for_my_api"></a><h3>How do I determine what licenses will be available for my API?</h3>
<p>There are a couple of steps you'll need to complete in your API setup to define the licenses that app developers will see when requesting access to your API:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In your API setup, make sure that the Use Licenses box is checked. Go to the <em>API Details</em> page, click <strong>Edit</strong>, and verify that the box is checked.</li>
  <li>Do scope mapping. From the <em>API Details</em> page, click <strong>Scope Mapping</strong>. For instructions, see <a href="#to_perform_scope_mapping">To perform scope mapping</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The scopes are the link between your API and the licenses that are offered to app developers. If you have any questions regarding which scopes to assign or which licenses will be available, consult your Business Admin.</p>
<p>For an overview of the Licenses feature and the relationship between the setup steps performed by the Business Admin and those done by the API Admin, and the relationship between scopes and licenses, see <a href="ov_licenses.htm">Licenses: Feature Overview</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_edit_the_license_on_an_api_access_request_api_administrator"></a><h3>How do I edit the license on an API access request?</h3>
<p>An API Administrator can change the license for a specific API Access Request prior to approving the request.</p>
<p>If you want to review the license scope of API access requests before approving, make sure you've selected the <strong>This API requires approval</strong> option in the API setup (<em>API</em> &gt; <em>Edit</em> &gt; <em>Proxy</em> page). If the API is set to auto-approve requests, you won't have the opportunity to modify the license.</p>
<h5>To edit the license scope for a pending API access request:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <em>APIs &gt; Apps</em>.</li>
  <li>Select the API Access Request you want to modify. It must have a status of <strong>Access Pending</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click<strong> Edit.</strong> The <em>API Access Wizard</em> launches and loads the <em>Licenses</em> page.</li>
  <li>Change the license option as needed.</li>
  <li>Click through the rest of the wizard and then click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_scope_mapping_and_how_do_i_set_it_up"></a><h3>What is scope mapping and how do I set it up?</h3>
<p>If your API is using the Licenses feature, scope mapping is the key to defining which portions of your API will be available for which licenses. The scopes and licenses themselves are defined by the Business Admin, but at the API level you determine which operations are assigned to which scopes. This in turn determines which licenses will be available to app developers requesting access to your API.</p>
<p>For example, let's say your API includes a set of operations relating to calendar functionality and another set of operations relating to email access and management. App A might only need access to the calendar functionality, and App B might include an email client and might require access to the operations relating to email. The scope mapping feature enables you to group individual operations into logical groups that can be separately packaged into a license for App A and another for App B.</p>
<p>As another example, let's say you want to offer access to your GET operations, and a higher level of access, for a fee, to all operations including add, modify, and delete. The Business Admin defines READ and MODIFY scopes, and then assigns each to a separate license. The API Admin assigns GET operations to the READ scope and assigns all operations to the MODIFY scope. Users who choose the paid license get access to all scopes; users who choose the free license can only access the GET operations.</p>
<p>At runtime, when a request is received to an API proxy from a particular app, the request is only passed through to the API if it is using one of the specific operations covered by the license governing the API contract.</p>
<!--<p><em>Note: If your API is configured with OAuth, the scopes were defined as part of the initial OAuth Provider configuration in the Site Administration section. The Edit OAuth Details function on the API Details page includes a <strong>Scope Mapping</strong> function for this scenario.</em></p>-->
<a name="to_perform_scope_mapping"></a><h5>To perform scope mapping:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>First, make sure the Licenses feature is enabled in the API. From the <em>API Details</em> page, click<strong> Edit</strong>, and make sure the <strong>Use Licenses</strong> checkbox is checked.</li>
  <li>From the <em>API Details</em> page, click <strong>Scope Mapping</strong>. The <em>Edit API Scope</em> page displays.</li>
  <li>Choose a scope mapping approach:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>API-wide Mapping</strong>: choose this if you're not subdividing your operations for licensing purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Operation-specific Mapping</strong>: choose this if you'll want to grant access to some portions of your API separately.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  
  <li>Operation-specific mapping only: For each operation, in the <em>Scope</em> column, click <strong>Select</strong>. The <em>Select Scope</em> popup displays. Choose one or more scopes for the operation and click <strong>Confirm</strong>.</li>
  <li>Repeat for each operation.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
