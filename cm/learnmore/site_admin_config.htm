<h3><a name="h_custom_styles"></a>Custom Styles:</h3>



<a name="i_want_to_customize_platform_styles"></a><h3>I want to customize platform styles. What do I do?</h3>
<p>The platform comes with a default look and feel, including styles, colors, navigation, logo, and so on. These platform default styles are stored in a stylesheet which is dynamically generated from a file named <strong>custom.less</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to customize platform styles, follow the basic steps below. If you want to start from the platform default styles and are modifying for the first time, follow the steps in <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_for_the_first_time">To customize platform styles for the first time</a>. If you have already modified your styles and want to make additional changes, use <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_additional_changes">To make additional changes to customized styles</a>.</p>
<p>For more information on what you can change, see <a href="#what_color_scheme_changes_are_supported_on_my_platform_deployment">What color scheme changes are supported on my platform deployment?</a></p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you upload new styles to the platform, you'll need to clear your browser cache and refresh the page to see the changes.</p>
<!--<p><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>custom.less</strong> is a subset of a larger site file, <strong>parameters.less</strong>, which includes additional variables you could customize; for example, the background color on tooltips is controlled by the <strong>tooltip-bg-color parameter</strong> in <strong>parameters.less</strong>, and this property is not present in <strong>custom.less</strong>. If you want to make customizations beyond the scope of <strong>custom.less</strong>, consult Technical Support for assistance in modifying the <strong>parameters.less</strong> file.</p>

<a name="After_i_update_my_customless_file_how_do_i_apply_the_changes_to_my_platform_deployment"></a><h3>After I update my custom.less file, how do I apply the changes to my platform deployment?</h3>
<p>After you update your <strong>custom.less</strong> file, you can apply the changes to the platform deployment by uploading the modified file. When you upload the file, the site automatically rebuilds the site style sheets and the changes are reflected on the site.
 See <a href="#how_do_i_upload_my_customless_file_after_i_have_updated_it">How do I upload my custom.less file after I have updated it?</a> for more information.</p>
<p> If the style sheet and sprite file changes are not visible immediately after the style sheet rebuild process is complete, clear the browser cache and then refresh.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you want to go back to the default styles at any point, you can always go back to the <strong>custom_template.less</strong> file. See <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_for_the_first_time">To customize platform styles for the first time</a>.</em></p>

<a name="how_do_i_rebuild_my_color_scheme_styles_after_i_have_uploaded_the_customless_file"></a><h3>How do I rebuild my color scheme styles after I have uploaded the custom.less file?</h3>
<p>The <em>Administration > Config > Custom Styles</em> section includes a <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option that allows you to Initiate a rebuild of the platform style sheets. This option is primarily used when a platform update is installed that includes style sheet changes. This option is primarily used when a site update is performed where style sheet changes were made.</p>
<p>For example, if an update was applied to the site and the update included new additions to the UI that required style sheet changes; this would mean that the style sheets were not active immediately after the update was completed. In this case, the <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option would complete update process by regenerating the style sheets.</p>
<h5>To rebuild site style sheets:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em>.</li>
  <li>If you want to work with the template for the Simple Developer Theme (Simple Dev) rather than the current user interface (Default Theme), choose it from the drop-down list at the top.

For more information, see <a href="#what_is_a_platform_theme">What is a platform theme?</a> and <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_theme_simpledev">Simple Developer theme</a>. </li>
  <li>In the <strong>Styles Customization</strong> section, click <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong>. The rebuild process takes approximately one minute. After style sheets have been rebuilt, the &quot;Platform style sheets have been successfully regenerated using custom.less&quot; confirmation message displays.</li>
  <li>After the style sheets are regenerated, clear the browser cache and refresh the screen to view the changes.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_a_sprite"></a><h3>What is a sprite?</h3>
<p>The platform UI includes a series of standard icons that accommodate quick filters, help, menu navigation names, window titles, etc. These standard icons cannot be changed, but when a UI customization is performed the color of the icon can be changed.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A sprite is a two-dimensional image that is used to change the color of the standard icons on the platform when a UI customization is performed.</li>
  <li>When developing your UI customization design, in addition to deciding what colors you want to use on your site, you must also decide what icons and "contrasts" are needed before moving forward with the customization tasks. This task should be part of your site UI design process.</li>
  <li>The platform provides a set of sprite files with the default theme. You can view how the sprite files are specified in the custom_template.less file. Each one is commented with " // path to the image file" and lists a URL that represents the path of the file.</li>
  <li><em>Note that sprite files should always be uploaded after you have uploaded and regenerated your style sheets. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/spriteimagefolder.jpg" width="600" height="303" alt="" /></p>
<p>Figure. Upload sprite files to \images folder via <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> (Resources &gt; File Manager)</p><br />
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_modify_sprite_colors"></a><h3>How do I modify sprite colors?</h3>
<p>During the UI design phase of your platform deployment your brand standards and colors are selected. The site includes a series of icons. The icon design is fixed and part of the site design, but the icon color and contrast can be changed. The general process for modifying icon colors involves the following steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To change icon color and contrast, a series of sprite files that define the color contrast for platform icons must be updated by modifying the  Adobe Illustrator production file provided by SOA Software.</li>
  <li>The process involves selecting the Artboard that includes the icon you want to modify, changing the icon color, and saving the Artboard to a PNG file. The PNG file(s) must then be uploaded to the /resources/theme/default/styles/images folder via <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> to be updated in your platform UI.</li>
  <li>For detailed instructions on how to modify sprite files, click <a href="images/modify_sprite_colors.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
  <li>If you save a sprite file to filename that is not referenced in the custom_template.less file, edit the custom_template.less file and update the path to reflect the new filename. For example, if a particular icon was gray and you wanted it changed to orange, you might save your artwork to a new filename that reflected the color change or you could develop a naming convention using numbers, etc. The following example is an excerpt from a custom_template.less file that illustrates a sprite file URL reference:
<pre>// path to the image file of 18px sprites of leftnav navigation items that reflect the current section of &quot;subject&quot; details
// @leftnav-active-icons: @icon-active-18px: url(&quot;images/sprites_18_color.png&quot;);
</pre>
</li>
  <li>If you updated a style sheet, use the <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option to regenerate the styles before uploading any new sprite files. Note that this function rebuilds all the folders in the /resources/theme/default/styles directory. Because of this, new sprite files must be uploaded after the site styles are regenerated.</li>
  <li>If you add a new Artboard to the Adobe illustrator production file, or save an existing Artboard as a different name, you must upload the updated sprite files to platform via the <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> section and save them in the /resources/theme/default/style/images folder. This step should be performed after the <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option is used.</li>
  <li>After styles are regenerated and sprite files are uploaded, clear the browser cache and refresh the screen to view the changes.</li>
  <li>For information on uploading Sprite files to the platform, see <a href="#how_do_i_upload_sprite_files_to_the_platform">How do I upload Sprite files to the platform?</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="what_is_lessjs_and_what_are_the_benefits"></a><h3>What is less.js and what are the benefits?</h3>
<p>The custom.less style sheet is implemented with LESS which is a dynamic stylesheet language that extends the static CSS by adding a dynamic behavior in the CSS.</p>
<ul>
  <li>LESS.JS is a CSS pre-processor that allows you to write your own styles using the LESS pre-processor language and save them in a .LESS file.</li>
  <li>LESS.JS will compile the file into pure CSS. LESS variables are defined with an @ sign and Variable assignment is done with a colon (:). After you update the custom.less style sheet and rebuild, the values of the variables are inserted into the output CSS document.</li>
  <li>LESS helps reduce the size of the CSS and allows you to quickly and easily make changes to the platform color scheme and sprite files by updating one custom.less file and then rebuilding the complete set of site stylesheets.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how_do_i_configure_a_custom_footer"></a><h3>How do I configure a custom footer?</h3>
<p>The footer customization process includes the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Footer customization is done with an HTML file that acts as a template. The HTML file is uploaded to the /resources/templates/footer with the name footer.htm.</li>
  <li>Links in the footer.htm file can have a class attribute with values "ext" or "dialog." When a link has a class "ext," clicking on the link will open a popup window. When the link has a class "dialog," clicking on the link will open the href in a dialog window.</li>
  <li>A footer can be uploaded using the File Manager in the <em>Site Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources &gt; Resources </em>section. An uploaded footer becomes effective within five minutes if the page is refreshed after five minutes.</li>
  <li>If the footer.htm file requires additional styles, you can add them to custom.less.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_configure_a_custom_logo"></a><h3>How do I configure a custom logo?</h3>
<p>The process of adding a custom logo to the platform includes configuring your logo to comply with the logo file requirements (listed below), specifying the logo filename in the template (see <a href="#to_customize_your_logo_filename">To specify your logo filename in the template</a> below) and uploading it to the platform (see <a href="#to_upload_your_logo_file">To upload your logo file</a> below).</p>

<a name="what_is_a_platform_theme"></a><h3>What is a platform theme?</h3>
<p>One theme is one instance of the portal. During installation, the Site Admin has the option to configure more than one theme for the implementation. This is configured as part of running the jython scripts which are part of installation. Each theme has a separate URL.</p>
<p>When running the jython platform installation script, two parameters, <strong>theme</strong> and <strong>themeimpl</strong>, work together to establish the codebase that's installed.</p>
<p>If values are provided for both <strong>theme</strong> and <strong>themeImpl</strong> parameters: <strong>themeImpl</strong> is a unique code name for a specific theme which cannot be changed. It indicates the code base used for the implementation. Valid values: default or simpledev.</p>
<p>This introduces the possibility of cloning a specific theme with two or more user-defined sets of customizations. One set of customizations is independent of another. Definitions of the two parameters are given below.</p>
<h4><strong>theme</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>theme</strong> parameter plays a different role as determined by whether the themeImpl parameter is also present:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If values are provided for both theme and themeImpl parameters: <strong>theme</strong> is a user-defined value. The customer can define multiple <strong>theme</strong> values, and each can later be customized via a unique custom.less file for each theme.</li>
  <li>If the themeImpl parameter is not provided (backwards compatibility scenario): <strong>theme</strong> takes the definition of the themeImpl parameter (see themeImpl below). Valid values: default or simpledev.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>themeImpl</strong></h4>
<p>If values are provided for both <strong>theme</strong> and <strong>themeImpl</strong> parameters: <strong>themeImpl</strong> is a unique code name for a specific theme which cannot be changed. It indicates the code base used for the implementation. Valid values: default or simpledev.</p>
<p>The new parameter takes the definitions previously applicable to the <strong>theme</strong> parameter. There are two valid values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>default</strong> (used in most cases)</li>
  <li><strong>simpledev</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>theme</strong> parameter now takes a customer-defined value, naming a theme that the customer can then customize via the <strong>custom.less</strong> file. The customer can define multiple values for the <strong>theme</strong> parameter; each name must be unique for the tenant.<br />
  For backwards compatibility, if the <strong>themeImpl</strong> parameter is not present in the installation jython script, the value provided for the <strong>theme</strong> parameter in the installation script must be one of the valid core values of <strong>default</strong> or <strong>simpledev</strong>.</p>
<p>By using these two parameters together, customers can define multiple access points into the platform, each of which can have its own set of customizations applied. Some sample scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Multiple customizations of look and feel</strong>: Tenant ACMEPayments Corp has 10 partners; each partner has a different API on the platform, and each has an API admin who accesses the platform and exports metric information for the API.
    <p>When installing version 7.2, the site admin defines the <strong>themeImpl</strong> parameter as <strong>default</strong> and creates 10 themes, each named for one of the 10 partners, and each with a different URL that includes the tenant name and partner name.</p>
<p>After installation, the site admin customizes each version by uploading a <strong>custom.less</strong> file for each partner with the partner&rsquo;s company colors and logo.</p>
<p>When each API admin logs in via the URL for his company, he sees the colors and logo for his company.</p>
</li>
  <li><strong>Two theme implementations, additional theme customizations</strong>: Tenant ACMEPaymentDev Inc. has two audiences, a developer audience and an API Admin audience.
<p>In previous versions, this scenario was supported in only one customer case by supporting two completely different themes (one of which was a completely customer-specific customization). Although this solution allowed us to support two themes, it was not extensible.</p>
<p>Now, the same solution can be accomplished for any customer by supporting two themes, default and simpledev. But each theme could also be cloned, defining values for the theme property of default and simpledev and then also providing values for the theme property, allowing additional customization to be supported.</p>
<p>When creating the tenant, we just create a single theme. Additional theme values, and themeImpl values, are created using additional database scripts as shown later.</p>
<p>Two theme example: when installing version 7.2, the site admin defines the <strong>themeImpl</strong> parameter as <strong>default</strong> and then again as <strong>simpledev</strong>, and creates two themes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>developer</strong> uses the <strong>simpledev</strong> theme</li>
  <li><strong>apiadmin</strong> uses the <strong>default</strong> theme</li>
</ul>
<p>He does not bother with a <strong>custom.less</strong> file since having a different look and feel is not significant at the moment, but this can easily be added later at any point.</p>
<p>Developers see the simpler user interface presented by the <strong>simpledev</strong> theme, while API Admins have access to the API management functionality offered only in the <strong>default</strong> theme.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="h_logins"></a>Logins:</h3>



<a name="how_does_login_configuration_work"></a><h3>How does login configuration work?</h3>
<p>As part of the initial platform setup, a Site Administrator sets up a series of domains that represent an enterprise's login requirements for the platform. Supported domain types for the platform login include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Platform Login</li>
  <li>Google&reg; Connector</li>
  <li>Facebook&reg; Connector</li>
  <li>LDAP</li>
  <li>CA SiteMinder&reg;</li>
  <li>OAuth Provider</li>
  <li>OpenID Relying Party</li>
</ul>
<p>In versions prior to 7.1.0, the platform installation also included a default platform domain that is automatically enabled when a new user account is created. In 7.1.0 and later, the default platform login domain is still there but it is not enabled by default. The Site Admin must manually enable the platform login domain as part of configuration.</p>
<p>After any desired login domains are installed, The Site Admin must enable them before they will be available to users. Additional configuration steps are also available, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Target Host (virtual host name)</li>
  <li>Logo/Avatar (Login Button)</li>
  <li>External login screen display mode (popup window or main window)</li>
</ul>
<p>For instructions on configuring login domains, see <a href="site_admin_domains.htm#how_do_i_enable_a_domain_for_login">How do I enable a domain for login?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="does_the_platform_provide_a_default_login"></a><h3>Does the platform provide a default login?</h3>
<p>No. In versions prior to 7.1.0, the platform installation supported certain security domains that allow login with email address and password to be automatically enabled for use once the security domain was created.</p>
<p>As of version 7.1.0, this default has been removed. The platform does not allow the default platform login screen to fall back to security domains supporting email/password-based login.</p>
<p>If your platform already had logins configured prior to upgrading to the version 7.1.0 release, the default option and configuration will be remain in place after upgrading. However, if you install 7.1.0 and then configure, you'll need to add the login domains and then enable them, in two separate steps.</p>
<p>For more information, including instructions for restoring the default by running a database query, see <a href="#how_do_i_enable_and_customize_a_login_domain">How do I enable and customize a platform login domain?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_enable_and_customize_a_login_domain"></a>
<h3>How do I enable and customize a platform login domain?</h3>
<p>There are two steps to setting up a login domain on the platform:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create the domain. In some cases, this requires some setup in Policy Manager. For instructions on setting up the specific type of login domain you want, see <a href="site_admin_domains.htm">Domains</a>.</li>
  <li>Complete the configuration by enabling and customizing the login domain. See below for instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In versions prior to the 7.1.0 release, certain security domains that allow login with email address and password were automatically enabled once the security domain was created in Administration / Domains. The default has now been changed so that the default platform login screen does not fall back to security domains supporting email/password-based login. Instead, you must explicitly enable the login domain after adding it. If you have already configured the platform prior to upgrading to the version 7.1.0 release, your default option and configuration will be unchanged after upgrading. However, if you install any version 7.1.0 or later, and then configure, you'll need to add the login domains and then enable them, in two separate steps.</p>
<h5><a name="to_enable_and_customize_a_platform_login_domain"></a>To enable and customize a platform login domain:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Site Admin and click the <em>Administration</em> quick filter (wrench icon).</li>
  <li>Create the domain, following the instructions for the specific type of login domain you want: see <a href="site_admin_domains.htm">Domains</a>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Logins</strong>.</li>
  <li>Check the <strong>Enable</strong> checkbox.</li>
  <li>If you would like to configure a virtual host for the domain, enter it in the &quot;Target Host&quot; text box. For more information, see <a href="site_admin_config.htm#what_is_a_target_host">What is a Target Host?</a> below.</li>
  <li>In the Logo/Avatar column, click <strong>Upload</strong> and select the logo you would like to display for the Login button. for more information, see <a href="basics_account_management.htm#how_do_i_upload_and_crop_icons">How do I upload and crop icons?</a> below. You can upload your own custom button or refer to information from the provider, if available. For example:
  <ul>
    <li>Facebook login button usage: <a href="https://www.facebookbrand.com" target="_blank">https://www.facebookbrand.com</a></li>
    <li>LDAP: refer to the LDAP developer documentation for information on LDAP login button usage</li>

  <li>In the Mode column, click the applicable button to indicate whether you want the login to be a popup or to display in the main window. For more information, see <a href="#what_login_page_integration_modes_are_supported">What login page integration modes are supported?</a> below.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For new installations, if you want to restore the old setting so that platform login falls back to security domains supporting email/password login, run the following query on the database (line break added for display purposes only, query should not include line break):</p>
<pre>update LOGIN_RULES set AUTO_LOGIN_EXT_DOMAIN='com.soa.feature.enabled' where BUSINESSID in <br />(select BUSINESSID from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='&lt;tenantid&gt;';</pre>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_a_target_host"></a><h3>What is a Target Host?</h3>
<p>The Site Administrator can specify multiple URLs for logging into the platform. This could be used to provide a different login based on role (Business Admin, API Admin, Developer, and so forth), or for a backdoor login if one of the domain configurations is down. This is accomplished by specifying a <em><a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_targethost">Target Host</a></em> address (virtual host address) for each login domain; for example, &lt;role&gt;.&lt;company&gt;.com.</p>
<p>It is best to develop a login plan for each role that covers different types of login scenarios. For example, if your site uses CA SiteMinder exclusively for logins, and the CA SiteMinder login is down for some reason, you will need a backdoor login to investigate the problem. To provide a resolution for this scenario, here are two possible approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Configure the platform default login Target Host so that only the Site Administrator can log in using email and password credentials.</li>
  <li>Configure an alternate Facebook domain (using the Facebook Connector domain) or Google login domain (using the OpenID Connect domain) and specify a Target Host for backdoor logins.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_login_page_integration_modes_are_supported"></a><h3>What login page integration modes are supported?</h3>
<p>The platform allows you to select how the login page associated with a login domain is displayed to the user when logging in. The integration method is selected via the <strong>Mode</strong> option on the <em>Site Administration &gt; Config &gt; Logins</em> page for a specific domain. Two options are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Popup</em>&#8212;Displays the external login page as a popup window.</li>
  <li><em>Main</em>&#8212;Displays the external login page in the platform home page instead of as a popup.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Mode options are not configurable for the default login page. </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_configure_a_session_timeout_value"></a><h3>How do I configure a session timeout value?</h3>
<p>You can configure a session timeout value for the platform, so that if a user is inactive for a specified period of time the user is automatically logged out.</p>
<p>Currently, you cannot change this setting via the user interface, but you can do it by running a database query. Replace the values in angle brackets below (remove the angle brackets also):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>&lt;no-of-minutes&gt;</strong>: replace with the session timeout value you want, in minutes. If the value is set to 0 (zero) there is no timeout; if it is set to 30, the session times out after 30 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>&lt;tenant-id&gt;</strong>: replace with your specific tenant ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>Update the values, and then run the following query on your database:</p>
<pre>update LOGIN_RULES set LOGIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT=<strong>&lt;no-of-minutes&gt;</strong> where TENANTID = (select TENANTID from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='<strong>&lt;tenant-id&gt;</strong>');</pre>

<p>For security reasons, you might want to disable the ability for users to change the email address associated with local accounts set up on the platform.</p>
<p>Currently, you cannot change this setting via the user interface, but you can do it in the database, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Table</strong>: BUSINESS_SECURITY_SETTINGS</li>
  <li><strong>Column name</strong>: USER_MODIFY_EMAIL</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="h_resources"></a>Resources:</h3>



<a name="what_is_a_resource"></a><h3>What is a Resource?</h3>
<p>In the context of the <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> section available to the Site Admin, a Resource is any type of publishing artifact used in the construction of the platform UI presentation. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> css style sheets</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Sprite files</li>
  <li>Site copy</li>
  <li>The site legal agreement</li>
  <li>API documentation, legal agreements, and downloadable files</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_the_difference_between_resources_and_content"></a><h3>What's the difference between Resources and Content?</h3>
<p>When you log in as the Site Admin and go to the <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> section, you'll see two buttons to access File Manager:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Resources</strong>
  <p>The Resources button takes you to the /resources folder for your implementation. From here, you can upload files and create folders. Use this location for assets that do not require indexing, such as images and Sprite files.</p>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: For site styles, use the Config &gt; Custom Styles option; see <a href="#i_want_to_customize_platform_styles">I want to customize platform styles. What do I do?</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Content</strong>
    <p>The Content button takes you to the /content folder for your implementation. Here, you can upload customized content files for the platform help and the platform legal agreement. You can also upload API documentation and API legal agreements, for any APIs already created on the platform. If you're uploading API documentation you'll need to know the APIID so that you choose the correct folder.</p>
    <p> Files uploaded to this location are indexed periodically, automatically, so that content is available for your site users when they use the Search feature to look for content.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>  For more information on the file and folder structure for your implementation, as it relates to files you might want to upload or customize, see <a href="#what_is_the_folder_structure_for_content_default">What is the folder structure for content in Default Theme?</a> and <a href="#what_is_the_folder_structure_for_content_sd">What is the folder structure for content in Simple Developer Theme?</a> below. </p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_the_folder_structure_for_content_default"></a><h3>What is the folder structure for content in Default Theme?</h3>
<p>If you're uploading content to the platform, via <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> &gt; <em>Content</em>, you'll need to make sure you place files in the correct folders.</p>
<p>Clicking the <strong>Content</strong> button takes you to File Manager where you can create folders, navigate up and down the folder structure, and upload single files or ZIP files. When you're uploading files, it's important to make sure you're in the right folder. You cannot move files.</p>
<p>The Content button takes you to the top level of the folder structure, the <strong>/content</strong> folder. From there, the folder structure is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>/api</strong>: top folder for any API documentation. When an API is added on the platform, a documentation folder is created. Click through to a specific API to upload API documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>/home</strong>: top folder for site content. From here there are additional subfolders:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>/landing</strong> for the site landing page and legal agreement (ideally HTML and PDF, but only one agreement)</li>
      <li><strong>/learnmore</strong> where the site content files are located.</li>
      <li><strong>/signup/confirm</strong> for the signup page.</li>
      <li><strong>/support</strong> for the support page and other content.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>For example, let's say you want to customize the Support page. The URL for the page is: &lt;hostname&gt;/#/home/support. You would go to <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> &gt; <em>Content</em>, to access the Content folder. In the File Explorer, click to navigate down to the home folder, then click to navigate down to the support folder. In this folder you will see index.htm which is the default page. To upload a replacement file, click <strong>Upload a File</strong> and navigate to the location of the new file.</p>
<p>If needed, you can save out the existing HTML; choose to view the file in the browser, click View Source, and then copy the HTML. Or you can export the fileset, which will include referenced assets.</p>

<a name="what_is_the_folder_structure_for_content_sd"></a><h3>What is the folder structure for content in Simple Developer Theme?</h3>
<p>The Simple Developer theme shares the same file and folder structure as Default Theme (see <a href="#what_is_the_folder_structure_for_content_default">What is the folder structure for content in Default Theme?</a> above), but uses different folders for content.</p>
<p>Simple Developer theme, by default, includes the following three content files/folders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documentation page: documentation/index.htm. In the user interface, this is accessed via the Documentation link at the center of the top menu bar.</li>
  <li>Help page: documentation/index.htm. In the user interface, this is accessed via the Help link, right of top menu bar.</li>
  <li>Welcome page: documentation/index.htm. In the user interface, this is accessed by clicking on the logo at the top left.</li>
  </ul>
<p>In the file system, these are represented by a structure of three subfolders in the main /content/ folder:</p>
<ul>
  <li>content/documentation/index.htm</li>
  <li>content/help/index.htm</li>
  <li>content/welcome/index.htm</li>

<a name="how_do_i_upload_content_sd"></a><h3>How do I upload content for Simple Developer theme?</h3>
<p>The Simple Developer theme shares the same file and folder structure as Default Theme, but uses different folders for content. If you want to replace existing content, you must mirror the existing folder structure, as given in <a href="#what_is_the_folder_structure_for_content_sd">What is the folder structure for content in Simple Developer Theme?</a> above.</p>
<p>When you navigate to the <strong>content</strong> folder in File Explorer, you won't see these subfolders and files. However, to update the content, you must use identical folder and file names. Create the folder, click into the folder, and then upload the revised file, as explained below.</p>
<h5>To update a Simple Developer default page</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in to the platform (Default Theme) as a Site Administrator.</li>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Administration</em> &gt; <em>Config &gt; Resources</em>.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Content</em> section, click <strong>File Manager</strong> to access the Content folder.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>New Directory</strong>, and create a folder with the exact name of the folder in which you want to update the content: for example, <strong>help</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click the new folder to go into it in File Explorer.</li>
  <li>Click Upload a File.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the location of the updated file and upload it. You can also upload a zip archive if you want to add multiple files or assets.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Upload</strong>. The file is uploaded.</li>

<a name="how_do_i_upload_style_sheets_to_the_platform"></a><h3>How do I upload style sheets to the platform?</h3>
<p>When you upload a new custom.less file in the <em>Custom Styles</em> section, the /resources/theme/default/style directory is automatically created and includes the site default style sheets. Some points to note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>These style sheets cannot be updated using the upload process used for static content because the styles are regenerated each time a new <strong>custom.less</strong> style sheet is uploaded.</li>
  <li>If you want to add new styles to the platform, you must first download the template, custom_template.less, then rename it to custom.less, add the new styles to the custom.less file, and upload the modified file. When you upload the revised file in the Config section of the user interface, the new styles are added to the site as part of the rebuild process. For more information and detailed instructions, see <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_for_the_first_time">To customize platform styles for the first time</a>.</li>

<a name="how_do_i_configure_separate_notification_addresses_by_theme"></a><h3>How do I configure separate notification addresses for different platform themes?</h3>
<p>The platform sends out email notifications to keep platform users informed about specific events&#8212;for example, password reset or changes to a team that the user is a member of. Some of these notifications include the platform URL; for example, the Welcome email includes the platform homepage URL for logging in. </p>
<p>If you have more than one theme configured for your platform installation, each theme has a separate URL. If a developer using your theme B forgets his password, the notification with the reset password link must include the URL for Theme B, not for Theme A. Therefore, you will need to take some extra steps so that, where applicable, the notifications triggered by activity on a specific theme use the correct URL for that theme.</p>
<p>Since the theme which by default we call Simple Dev has a simpler user interface and is focused on a developer audience, and the theme which we call Default Theme includes additional functionality, such as API and business management and Site Admin functions, notifications for roles more applicable to Default Theme are always sent out from the Default Theme URL. These roles include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Site Admin</li>
  <li>Business Admin</li>
  <li>API Admin</li>
</ul>
<p>Notifications for the following roles use a theme-specific URL:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anonymous user (not signed in as a platform user; for example, in a &quot;forgot password&quot; scenario)</li>
  <li>Developer</li>
  <li>App team member</li>
</ul>
<p> For a full list of roles and the types of notifications that are sent to each role, see <a href="site_admin_users.htm#what_are_the_user_roles_for_notifications">What are the user roles for notifications sent out from the platform?</a></p>
<p>When there are multiple themes configured for the tenant, you will need to run a script to load the TENANT_THEME_ROLES table and map the theme &gt; roles roles list. This table tells the platform which theme is used for which notifications.</p>
<p>In the NOTIFICATION_ROLES table, each notification template is mapped to the role that it is meant for. Before a notification is sent out, the tenant.console.address variable is replace with the theme-specific URL for the role that the specific notification template is mapped to.</p>
<p>In a few cases, multiple themes might be possible for the same notification. For example, a user of any theme might request a password reset. In this case, the platform uses the URL for the theme that caused the notification to be generated. The Forgot Password notification will include the address of the console for the theme in which the user initiated the Forgot Password request. In an upgrade scenario, or if the database modification to the the TENANT_THEME_ROLES table, as below, has not been done, no themes will be mapped to any roles. In that case, we use the default theme assigned to the tenant.</p>
<p>The theme-specific feature cannot be configured in the user interface. Instead, you must run a database script. A template is shown below; this uses variable placeholders for theme name, role name, and tenant name.</p>

<pre>insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, '&lt;theme&gt;', '&lt;rolename&gt;' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='&lt;tenant-name&gt;';</pre>
<p>If there is only one tenant, you can omit the tenant name, like this:</p>
<pre>insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, '&lt;theme&gt;', '&lt;rolename&gt;' from TENANTS;
</pre>
<p>An example is shown below, using the theme names <strong>default</strong> and <strong>simpledev</strong>. In the below, substitute a value for the &lt;tenant-name&gt; variable or, if there is only one tenant, remove the <strong>where</strong> statement. If you are using different theme names, substitute the applicable values.</p>
<pre>insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'default', 'Anonymous User' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='&lt;tenant-name&gt;';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'default', 'ApiAdmin' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='&lt;tenant-name&gt;';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'default', 'BusinessAdmin' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='&lt;tenant-name&gt;';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'default', 'SiteAdmin' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='&lt;tenant-name&gt;';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'simpledev', 'User' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='&lt;tenant-name&gt;';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'simpledev', 'Anonymous User' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='&lt;tenant-name&gt;';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'simpledev', 'AppAdmin' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='&lt;tenant-name&gt;';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'simpledev', 'Developer' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='&lt;tenant-name&gt;';

<a name="what_is_the_csrf_prevention_feature"></a><h3>What is the CSRF prevention feature?</h3>
<p>The CSRF prevention feature adds a layer of protection against malicious <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_csrf_attack">CSRF</a> attacks, by means of a custom header.</p>
<p>A CSRF attack leverages the fact that the authorized user has already authenticated, and that the cookie is stored in the user's browser. The CSRF prevention feature requires an additional value to be sent as an extra header. If the extra header is not present, the request is rejected as unauthorized.</p>
<p>An authorized app developer can get the value from the cookie and compose and send the custom header with the request message.</p>
<p>The new header is the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_xcsrf_token_fedmemberidheader">X-Csrf-Token_fedmemberID</a> header. The app must take the value in the new Csrf-Token_fedmemberid cookie and send it as the value for the X-Csrf-Token_fedmemberID header in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All POST operations</li>
  <li>All PUT operations</li>
  <li>All DELETE operations  </li>
  <li>All GET operations <strong>except</strong> those in the following services/activities:
<ul>
      <li>Content upload and management</li>
      <li>Resource upload and management (such as avatars)</li>
      <li>Login</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>The <strong>Csrf-Token_fedmemberid</strong> cookie has the same timeout value as the <strong>AtmoAuthToken</strong> authorization cookie (as specified by the Site Admin, or 25 minutes by default).</p>
<p>For information on how to implement the CSRF prevention header, see <a href="#how_do_i_implement_csrf_prevention_feature">How do I implement the CSRF prevention feature?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_implement_csrf_prevention_feature"></a><h3>How do I implement the CSRF prevention feature?</h3>
<p>If you're concerned about malicious <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_csrf_attack">CSRF</a> attacks, make sure the CSRF prevention feature is in effect. This feature is turned on by default in new implementations, and turned off by default in existing implementations that upgrade to any version of the platform after version 7.1.3.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from an existing version and want to implement the CSRF prevention feature, <a href="basics_support.htm#how_do_i_contact_technical_support">contact technical support</a>. If you already have a custom client, refer to <a href="#csrf_prevention_custom_client">I want CSRF prevention, but we already have a custom client. What do I do?</a> below.</p>
<p>If yours is a new installation and you want to turn off the CSRF prevention feature, <a href="basics_support.htm#how_do_i_contact_technical_support">contact technical support</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="csrf_prevention_custom_client"></a>
<h3>I want CSRF prevention, but we already have a custom client. What do I do?</h3>
<p>If your implementation includes the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_csrf_attack">CSRF</a> prevention feature, this requires all messages to POST, PUT, or DELETE operations to use the new <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_xcsrf_token_fedmemberidheader">X-Csrf-Token_fedmemberID</a> custom header.</p>
<p>However, if you already have a client that sends and receives messages to Community Manager, when you implement the new feature, messages from the client will be refused because they don't have the custom header.</p>
<p>To support this feature in scenarios where there is an existing client that doesn't use the custom headers, there is a configuration setting you can use to specify that your client is a trusted sender and the custom header is not required. When the sending client is listed in this configuration setting, the messages are processed without the custom header.</p>
<p>In the configuration settings, under com.soa.atmosphere, choose atmosphere.config.csrfHttpWriteSkipUserAgents. This setting supports Network Director and federated Community Manager scenarios invoking Community Manager APIs without having to send the CSRF token. </p>
<p>For more information about accessing and modifying this setting, see <a href="site_admin_admin_console_settings.htm#cm_settings_navigation">How do I get to the Community Manager Configuration Settings in the SOA Software Administration Console?</a></p>

<a name="how_do_i_configure_security_challenge_questions"></a><h3>How do I configure security challenge questions?</h3>
<p>The platform includes a feature whereby you can configure security challenge questions to be offered to user signing up.</p>
<p>By default, a user signing up is asked to answer three questions. The user's answers are stored securely in the database and the questions/answers are used as additional security for certain sensitive operations, such as when the user requests a password reset.</p>
<p>Later, as part of managing the user profile, the user can modify answers to existing questions, or can choose one or more different questions from the list provided and then answer the new questions.</p>
<p>In some cases, the user's answer might not be displayed, depending on the site's security settings.</p>
<p>The Site Admin can choose from certain questions that are set up by default, to be offered to users, or can compose different questions.</p>
<p>This feature adds another layer of security for the user's account.</p>
<p>Site Admin management of this feature is not currently available via the user interface. You can do this in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By a database script. For more information, <a href="basics_support.htm#how_do_i_contact_technical_support">contact Technical Support</a>.</li>
  <li>Using the API: via the Save Challenges operation in the Businesses service. For more information, refer to <a href="http://docs.soa.com/cm/api/businesses/m_businesses_saveChallenges.htm" target="_blank">the API documentation for the <span class="apidoc_code">PUT&nbsp;/api/businesses/{BusinessID}/challenges</span> operation at docs.soa.com</a>.</li>

<a name="how_do_i_monitor_app_security_changes"></a><h3>I need to monitor app security changes. What do I do?</h3>
<p>By default, whenever an app developer makes a significant change to app credentials, the user is required to enter a comment regarding the action being done. A notification is posted to the app's Board regarding the action, the user performing the action, and the user's comment. This acts as an audit trail which you can also access via the database.</p>
<p>Comments are collected, and Board items generated, for the following events relating to app security:</p>
<ul>
  <li>App Shared Secret is regenerated.</li>
  <li>Credentials are uploaded.</li>
  <li>Credentials are modified.</li>
  <li>Credentials are removed.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how_do_i_add_a_platform_signup_legal_agreement"></a>
<h3>How do I add a platform signup legal agreement?</h3>
<p>You might want to have a platform legal agreement in place, that all platform users will accept. If a legal agreement is in place, the platform requires users to accept the agreement as a precondition before completing the login process.</p>
<p>If there is an existing legal agreement in place, you must disable it before adding a new one. You can only have one. See <a href="#how_do_i_change_the_platform_signup_legal_agreement">How do I change the platform signup legal agreement?</a> below.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: The platform supports use of only one legal agreement. Make sure all the legal requirements are combined into one document.</p>
<p>The user interface currently does not support managing of the legal agreement, but you can do this via the API or by running a database script.</p>
<h5>To add the legal agreement using the API</h5>
<p>To add a legal agreement there are two steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, upload the legal agreement file. You can do this in the user interface. See below.</li>
  <li>Then, make the new agreement the default for the platform using the API. In the Legals service, run the Create New Agreement operation (see <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="http://docs.soa.com/cm/api/legals/m_legals_createNewAgreement.htm" target="_blank">POST&nbsp;/api/legals</a></span> on docs.soa.com).</li>
</ol>
<h5>To upload a new legal agreement via the Community Manager user interface</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Administration</em> &gt; <em>Config &gt; Resources</em>.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Content</em> section, click <strong>File Manager</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click down to the Home folder, then to the Landing folder. If a folder doesn't exist, create it, using the exact names given here.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Upload a File</strong>, navigate to the location of the new developer agreement, and upload it.</li>
</ol>

<a name="how_do_i_change_the_platform_signup_legal_agreement"></a>
<h3>How do I change the platform signup legal agreement?</h3>
<p>If you have a legal agreement in place, and want to change it, you must first deactivate the existing agreement. Then, you can upload a new agreement following the instructions above.</p>
<h5>To deactivate an existing legal agreement</h5>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: The queries below remove any existing legal agreements, so if you uploaded more than one by mistake, this script will fix it.</p>
<p>For a multi-tenant install, use the script below. Replace the {<strong>tenantid</strong>} placeholder with the Tenant ID for your installation.. Note that line breaks have been added for display purposes. Your script should not have line breaks.</p>
<pre>update AGREEMENT_DOCUMENTS set ACTIVE='N' where TYPE='com.soa.atmosphere.legals.signup' 
and DOCUMENT_ID in (select NAMEID from DISTINGUISHED_NAMES where FEDMEMBERID='{tenantid}' and OBJECTTYPE='agreement');</pre>
<p>For a single-tenant install, use the query below exactly as it is. You do not need to substitute any values. Note that line breaks have been added for display purposes. Your script should not have line breaks.</p>
<pre>update AGREEMENT_DOCUMENTS set ACTIVE='N' where TYPE='com.soa.atmosphere.legals.signup' 
and DOCUMENT_ID in (select NAMEID from DISTINGUISHED_NAMES where OBJECTTYPE='agreement');</pre>
