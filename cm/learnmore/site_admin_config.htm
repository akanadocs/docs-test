<h3><a name="h_custom_styles"></a>Custom Styles:</h3>



<a name="i_want_to_customize_platform_styles"></a><h3>I want to customize platform styles. What do I do?</h3>
<p>The platform comes with a default look and feel, including styles, colors, navigation, logo, and so on. These platform default styles are stored in a stylesheet which is dynamically generated from a file named <strong>custom.less</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to customize platform styles, follow the basic steps below. If you want to start from the platform default styles and are modifying for the first time, follow the steps in <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_for_the_first_time">To customize platform styles for the first time</a>. If you have already modified your styles and want to make additional changes, use <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_additional_changes">To make additional changes to customized styles</a>.</p>

<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you upload new styles to the platform, you'll need to clear your browser cache and refresh the page to see the changes.</p>
<!--<p><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>custom.less</strong> is a subset of a larger site file, <strong>parameters.less</strong>, which includes additional variables you could customize; for example, the background color on tooltips is controlled by the <strong>tooltip-bg-color parameter</strong> in <strong>parameters.less</strong>, and this property is not present in <strong>custom.less</strong>. If you want to make customizations beyond the scope of <strong>custom.less</strong>, consult Technical Support for assistance in modifying the <strong>parameters.less</strong> file.</p>

<a name="how_do_i_customize_how_markdown_looks_in_the_developer_portal"></a><h3>How do I customize how Markdown looks in the developer portal?</h3>
<p>The developer portal includes a set of default style definitions for the styles supported for Markdown. These styles are defined in the platform's <strong>custom.less</strong> style file.</p>
<p>To customize the Markdown styles, download the <strong>custom.less</strong> file (Administration &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles) and search for <strong>Markdown</strong>. You'll see the section that defines the Markdown styles. For example:</p>
<pre>// @markdown-preview-font-size-h1: 36px;</pre>
<p>The above defines the style that's rendered for the h1 Markdown:</p>
<pre># This is a Heading 1 in Markdown</pre>
<p>Modify the styles you want to change, remove the comment marks on any lines that you've changed (// at the beginning of the line), and then upload the revised custom.less file. The platform rebuilds the css based on the uploaded file, and the new styles are effective for both new and revised user-generated board entries that use Markdown.</p>
<p>For example, to change the default color for headings to red, find this line:</p>
<pre>// @markdown-preview-headings-color: inherit;</pre>
<p>and change it, as per the example below (you can also use any color values supported by standard CSS):</p>
<pre>@markdown-preview-headings-color: red;</pre>
<p>Then upload the modified file. See <a href="#how_do_i_upload_my_customless_file_after_i_have_updated_it">How do I upload my custom.less file after I've updated it?</a></p>
<p>To see the changes immediately, you'll need to clear cache. Active users do not see the changes immediately since the styles are cached for up to 30 minutes. After that point, everyone will see the revised styles.</p>
<p>For more information on modifying custom styles, see <a href="#i_want_to_customize_platform_styles">I want to customize platform styles. What do I do?</a></p>
<p>For more information on the use of Markdown for board items in the developer portal, see <a href="basics_boards.htm#h_markdown">Using Markdown</a>.</p>

<a name="what_color_scheme_changes_are_supported_on_my_platform_deployment"></a><h3>What color scheme changes are supported on my platform deployment?</h3>
<p>You can change the color scheme for platform elements such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Site background color</li>
  <li>Left and top navigation</li>
  <li>Text content area</li>
  <li>Pop-up dialog elements</li>
  <li>Horizontal rules</li>
  <li>Text color of input fields</li>
  <li>Default link colors</li>
</ul>

<a name="what_style_sheets_do_i_use_to_update_the_color_scheme_on_my_platform_deployment"></a><h3>What style sheets do I use to update the color scheme of my platform deployment?</h3>
<p>The platform includes a style sheet template, <strong>custom_template.less</strong>, that you can download, rename to <strong>custom.less</strong>, and update based on your requirements. For full instructions, refer to <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_for_the_first_time">To customize platform styles for the first time</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some general points regarding the platform style sheet:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All of the variables and sprite file references in the custom_template.less file are configured with defaults that represent the look and feel of a default platform installation.</li>
  <li>All <strong>custom.less</strong> style sheet variables are commented out. For site elements you want to customize, remove the comment from the element and then customize the variable.</li>
  <li>Color management for icons is accomplished by modifying the Adobe Illustrator file that includes the sprite icons. <a href="assets/default_theme_sprites.zip">Download a ZIP containing the Adobe Illustrator files.</a></li>

<a name="after_i_update_my_customless_file_how_do_i_apply_the_changes_to_my_platform_deployment"></a><h3>After I update my custom.less file, how do I apply the changes to my platform deployment?</h3>
<p>After you update your <strong>custom.less</strong> file, you can apply the changes to the platform deployment by uploading the modified file. When you upload the file, the site automatically rebuilds the site style sheets and the changes are reflected on the site.
 See <a href="#how_do_i_upload_my_customless_file_after_i_have_updated_it">How do I upload my custom.less file after I've updated it?</a> for more information.</p>
<p>If the style sheet and sprite file changes are not visible immediately after the style sheet rebuild process is complete, clear the browser cache and then refresh.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you want to go back to the default styles at any point, you can always go back to the <strong>custom_template.less</strong> file. See <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_for_the_first_time">To customize platform styles for the first time</a>.</em></p>

<a name="how_do_i_rebuild_my_color_scheme_styles_after_i_have_uploaded_the_customless_file"></a><h3>How do I rebuild my color scheme styles after I have uploaded the custom.less file?</h3>
<p>The <em>Administration > Config > Custom Styles</em> section includes a <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option that allows you to Initiate a rebuild of the platform style sheets. This option is primarily used when a platform update is installed that includes style sheet changes. This option is primarily used when a site update is performed where style sheet changes were made.</p>
<p>For example, if an update was applied to the site and the update included new additions to the UI that required style sheet changes; this would mean that the style sheets were not active immediately after the update was completed. In this case, the <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option would complete update process by regenerating the style sheets.</p>
<h5>To rebuild site style sheets:</h5>
<ol>
  
  <li>Log in as the Site Admin.</li>
  <li>Go to <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em>.</li>
  <li>If you want to work with the template for the Simple Developer Theme (Simple Dev) rather than the current user interface (Default Theme), choose it from the drop-down list at the top (theme names might be different depending on your implementation).

  <li>In the <strong>Styles Customization</strong> section, click <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong>. The rebuild process takes approximately one minute. After style sheets have been rebuilt, the &quot;Platform style sheets have been successfully regenerated using custom.less&quot; confirmation message displays.</li>
  <li>After the style sheets are regenerated, clear the browser cache and refresh the screen to view the changes.</li>

<a name="what_is_a_sprite"></a><h3>What is a sprite?</h3>
<p>A sprite is a two-dimensional image used by the developer portal CSS to control the colors in platform default icons and images.</p>
<p>The platform UI includes a series of standard icons that are used for standard components of the UI such as quick filters, help, menu navigation names, and window titles. Although the icons and images cannot themselves be changed, the colors can be changed, as part of UI customization, by changing the colors of the sprite files.</p>
<p>When developing your UI customization design, in addition to deciding what colors you want to use on your site, you must also decide what icons and "contrasts" you want, before moving forward with the customization tasks. This task should be part of your site UI design process.</p>
<p>The platform provides a set of sprite files for Default Theme. You can view how the sprite files are specified, in the <strong>custom_template.less</strong> file. Each one is commented with " // path to the image file" and lists a URL that represents the path of the file.</p>
<p><em>Sprite files should always be uploaded <strong>after</strong> you have uploaded and regenerated your style sheets. </em>For instructions, see <a href="#how_do_i_upload_sprite_files_to_the_developer_portal">How do I upload sprite files to the developer portal?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_modify_sprite_colors"></a><h3>How do I modify sprite colors?</h3>
<p>During the UI design phase of your platform deployment your brand standards and colors are selected. The site includes a series of icons. The icon design is fixed and part of the site design, but the icon color and contrast can be changed by modifying the sprite files used by the platform icons. The general process for modifying icon colors involves the following steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To change icon color and contrast, you'll need to update one or more of a series of sprite files that define the color contrast for platform icons, by modifying the  applicable Adobe Illustrator file provided by Akana. <a href="assets/default_theme_sprites.zip">Download a ZIP containing the Adobe Illustrator files.</a></li>
  <li>The process involves selecting the Artboard that includes the icon you want to modify, changing the icon color, and saving the Artboard to a PNG file. The PNG file must then be uploaded to the /resources/theme/default/styles/images folder via <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> to be updated in your platform UI.</li>
  <li>For detailed instructions on how to modify sprite files, see <a href="assets/modify_sprite_colors.pdf" target="_blank">Modifying Sprite Colors</a> (separate PDF file).</li>
  <li>If you save a sprite file to a filename that is not referenced in the custom_template.less file, edit the custom_template.less file and update the path to reflect the new filename. For example, if a particular icon was gray and you wanted it changed to orange, you might save your artwork to a new filename that reflected the color change or you could develop a naming convention using numbers, etc. The following example is an excerpt from a custom_template.less file that illustrates a sprite file URL reference:
    <pre>// path to the image file of 18px sprites of leftnav navigation items that reflect the current section of &quot;subject&quot; details
// @leftnav-active-icons: @icon-active-18px: url(&quot;images/sprites_18_color.png&quot;);
</pre>
</li>
  <li>If you updated a style sheet, use the <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option to regenerate the styles before uploading any new sprite files. Note that this function rebuilds all the folders in the /resources/theme/default/styles directory. Because of this, new sprite files must be uploaded after the site styles are regenerated.</li>
  <li>If you add a new Artboard to the Adobe illustrator file, or save an existing Artboard with a different name, you must upload the updated sprite files to the platform via the <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> section and save them in the /resources/theme/default/style/images folder.

<a name="what_is_lessjs_and_what_are_the_benefits"></a><h3>What is less.js and what are the benefits?</h3>
<p>The custom.less style sheet is implemented with LESS which is a dynamic stylesheet language that extends the static CSS by adding a dynamic behavior in the CSS.</p>
<ul>
  <li>LESS.JS is a CSS pre-processor that allows you to write your own styles using the LESS pre-processor language and save them in a .LESS file.</li>
  <li>LESS.JS will compile the file into pure CSS. LESS variables are defined with an @ sign and Variable assignment is done with a colon (:). After you update the custom.less style sheet and rebuild, the values of the variables are inserted into the output CSS document.</li>
  <li>LESS helps reduce the size of the CSS and allows you to quickly and easily make changes to the platform color scheme and sprite files by updating one custom.less file and then rebuilding the complete set of site stylesheets.</li>

<a name="how_do_i_configure_a_custom_footer"></a><h3>How do I configure a custom footer?</h3>
<p>The footer customization process includes the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Footer customization is done with an HTML file that acts as a template. The HTML file is uploaded to the /resources/templates/footer with the name footer.htm.</li>
  <li>Links in the footer.htm file can have a class attribute with values "ext" or "dialog." When a link has a class "ext," clicking on the link will open a popup window. When the link has a class "dialog," clicking on the link will open the href in a dialog window.</li>
  <li>A footer can be uploaded using the File Manager in the <em>Site Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources &gt; Resources </em>section. An uploaded footer becomes effective within five minutes if the page is refreshed after five minutes.</li>
  <li>If the footer.htm file requires additional styles, you can add them to custom.less.</li>

<a name="what_is_a_platform_theme"></a><h3>What is a platform theme?</h3>
<p>One theme is one instance of the portal. During installation, the Site Admin has the option to configure more than one theme for the implementation. This is configured as part of running the jython scripts which are part of installation. Each theme has a separate URL.</p>
<p>When running the jython platform installation script, two parameters, <strong>theme</strong> and <strong>themeimpl</strong>, work together to establish the codebase that's installed.</p>
<p>If values are provided for both <strong>theme</strong> and <strong>themeImpl</strong> parameters: <strong>themeImpl</strong> is a unique code name for a specific theme which cannot be changed. It indicates the code base used for the implementation. Valid values: default or simpledev.</p>
<p>This introduces the possibility of cloning a specific theme with two or more user-defined sets of customizations. One set of customizations is independent of another. Definitions of the two parameters are given below.</p>
<h4><strong>theme</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>theme</strong> parameter plays a different role as determined by whether the themeImpl parameter is also present:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If values are provided for both theme and themeImpl parameters: <strong>theme</strong> is a user-defined value. The customer can define multiple <strong>theme</strong> values, and each can later be customized via a unique custom.less file for each theme.</li>
  <li>If the themeImpl parameter is not provided (backwards compatibility scenario): <strong>theme</strong> takes the definition of the themeImpl parameter (see themeImpl below). Valid values: default or simpledev.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>themeImpl</strong></h4>
<p>If values are provided for both <strong>theme</strong> and <strong>themeImpl</strong> parameters: <strong>themeImpl</strong> is a unique code name for a specific theme which cannot be changed. It indicates the code base used for the implementation. Valid values: default or simpledev.</p>
<p>The new parameter takes the definitions previously applicable to the <strong>theme</strong> parameter. There are two valid values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>default</strong> (used in most cases)</li>
  <li><strong>simpledev</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>theme</strong> parameter now takes a customer-defined value, naming a theme that the customer can then customize via the <strong>custom.less</strong> file. The customer can define multiple values for the <strong>theme</strong> parameter; each name must be unique for the tenant.<br />
  For backwards compatibility, if the <strong>themeImpl</strong> parameter is not present in the installation jython script, the value provided for the <strong>theme</strong> parameter in the installation script must be one of the valid core values of <strong>default</strong> or <strong>simpledev</strong>.</p>
<p>By using these two parameters together, customers can define multiple access points into the platform, each of which can have its own set of customizations applied. Some sample scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Multiple customizations of look and feel</strong>: Tenant ACMEPayments Corp has 10 partners; each partner has a different API on the platform, and each has an API admin who accesses the platform and exports metric information for the API.
    <p>When installing version 7.2, the site admin defines the <strong>themeImpl</strong> parameter as <strong>default</strong> and creates 10 themes, each named for one of the 10 partners, and each with a different URL that includes the tenant name and partner name.</p>
<p>After installation, the site admin customizes each version by uploading a <strong>custom.less</strong> file for each partner with the partner&rsquo;s company colors and logo.</p>
<p>When each API admin logs in via the URL for his company, he sees the colors and logo for his company.</p>
</li>
  <li><strong>Two theme implementations, additional theme customizations</strong>: Tenant ACMEPaymentDev Inc. has two audiences, a developer audience and an API Admin audience.
<p>In previous versions, this scenario was supported in only one customer case by supporting two completely different themes (one of which was a completely customer-specific customization). Although this solution allowed us to support two themes, it was not extensible.</p>
<p>Now, the same solution can be accomplished for any customer by supporting two themes, default and simpledev. But each theme could also be cloned, defining values for the theme property of default and simpledev and then also providing values for the theme property, allowing additional customization to be supported.</p>
<p>When creating the tenant, we just create a single theme. Additional theme values, and themeImpl values, are created using additional database scripts as shown later.</p>
<p>Two theme example: when installing version 7.2, the site admin defines the <strong>themeImpl</strong> parameter as <strong>default</strong> and then again as <strong>simpledev</strong>, and creates two themes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>developer</strong> uses the <strong>simpledev</strong> theme</li>
  <li><strong>apiadmin</strong> uses the <strong>default</strong> theme</li>
</ul>
<p>He does not bother with a <strong>custom.less</strong> file since having a different look and feel is not significant at the moment, but this can easily be added later at any point.</p>
<p>Developers see the simpler user interface presented by the <strong>simpledev</strong> theme, while API Admins have access to the API management functionality offered only in the <strong>default</strong> theme.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="h_logins"></a>Logins:</h3>



<a name="how_does_login_configuration_work"></a><h3>How does login configuration work?</h3>
<p>As part of the initial platform setup, a Site Administrator sets up a series of domains that represent an enterprise's login requirements for the platform. Supported domain types for the platform login include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Platform Login</li>
  <li>Google&reg; Connector</li>
  <li>Facebook&reg; Connector</li>
  <li>LDAP</li>
  <li>CA SiteMinder&reg;</li>
  <li>OAuth Provider</li>
  <li>OpenID Connect Relying Party</li>
</ul>
<p>In versions prior to 7.1.0, the platform installation also included a default platform domain that is automatically enabled when a new user account is created. In 7.1.0 and later, the default platform login domain is still there but it is not enabled by default. The Site Admin must manually enable the platform login domain as part of configuration.</p>
<p>After any desired login domains are installed, the Site Admin must enable them before they will be available to users. Additional configuration steps are also available, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Target Host (virtual hostname)</li>
  <li>Logo (the button that's displayed on the login page for this login domain. If not specified, defaults to the first letter of the domain name)</li>
  <li>External login screen display mode (popup window or main window)</li>
</ul>
<p>For instructions on configuring login domains, see <a href="site_admin_domains.htm#how_do_i_enable_a_domain_for_login">How do I enable a domain for login?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="does_the_platform_provide_a_default_login"></a><h3>Does the platform provide a default login?</h3>
<p>No. In versions prior to 7.1.0, the platform installation supported certain security domains that allow login with email address and password to be automatically enabled for use once the security domain was created.</p>
<p>As of version 7.1.0, this default has been removed. The platform does not allow the default platform login screen to fall back to security domains supporting email/password-based login.</p>
<p>If your platform already had logins configured prior to upgrading to the version 7.1.0 release, the default option and configuration will be remain in place after upgrading. However, if you install 7.1.0 and then configure, you'll need to add the login domains and then enable them, in two separate steps.</p>
<p>For more information, including instructions for restoring the default by running a database query, see <a href="#how_do_i_enable_and_customize_a_login_domain">How do I enable and customize a platform login domain?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_enable_and_customize_a_login_domain"></a><h3>How do I enable and customize a platform login domain?</h3>
<p>There are two steps to setting up a login domain on the platform:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create the domain. In some cases, this requires some setup in Policy Manager. For instructions on setting up the specific type of login domain you want, see <a href="site_admin_domains.htm">Domains</a>.</li>
  <li>Complete the configuration by enabling and customizing the login domain. See below for instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In versions prior to the 7.1.0 release, certain security domains that allow login with email address and password were automatically enabled once the security domain was created in Administration / Domains. The default has now been changed so that the default platform login screen does not fall back to security domains supporting email/password-based login. Instead, you must explicitly enable the login domain after adding it. If you have already configured the platform prior to upgrading to the version 7.1.0 release, your default option and configuration will be unchanged after upgrading. However, if you install any version 7.1.0 or later, and then configure, you'll need to add the login domains and then enable them, in two separate steps.</p>
<h5><a name="to_enable_and_customize_a_platform_login_domain"></a>To enable and customize a platform login domain:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Site Admin and click the <em>Administration</em> quick filter (wrench icon).</li>

  <li>Click <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Logins</strong>.</li>
  <li>Check the <strong>Enable</strong> checkbox.</li>
  <li>Conditional: to restrict the login domain so that only URLs from one or more specified target hosts are allowed, enter one or more values, separated by commas, in the text box in the <strong>Target Host</strong> column. For more information, see <a href="site_admin_config.htm#what_is_a_target_host">What is a Target Host?</a> below.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Logo</strong> column, click <strong>Upload</strong> and select the logo for the Login button.

<a name="what_is_a_target_host"></a><h3>What is a Target Host?</h3>
<p>The Site Administrator can specify one or more specific URLs that are valid logging into the platform. This could be used to provide a different login based on role (Business Admin, API Admin, Developer, and so forth), or for a backdoor login if one of the domain configurations is down. This is accomplished by specifying a <em><a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_targethost">Target Host</a></em> address (virtual host address) for each login domain; for example, {role}.{company}.com.</p>
<p>It is best to develop a login plan for each role that covers different types of login scenarios. For example, if your site uses CA SiteMinder exclusively for logins, and the CA SiteMinder login is down for some reason, you will need a backdoor login to investigate the problem. To provide a resolution for this scenario, here are two possible approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Configure the platform default login Target Host so that only the Site Administrator can log in using email and password credentials.</li>
  <li>Configure an alternate Facebook domain (using the Facebook Connector domain) or Google login domain (using the OpenID Connect domain) and specify a Target Host for backdoor logins.
  Only users from that specific target host will be able to log in using that domain.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_login_page_integration_modes_are_supported"></a><h3>What login page integration modes are supported?</h3>
<p>The platform allows you to select how the login page associated with a login domain is displayed to the user when logging in. The integration method is selected via the <strong>Mode</strong> option on the <em>Site Administration &gt; Config &gt; Logins</em> page for a specific domain. Two options are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Popup</em>&#8212;Displays the external login page as a popup window.</li>
  <li><em>Main</em>&#8212;Displays the external login page in the platform home page instead of as a popup.</li>

<a name="how_do_i_configure_a_session_timeout_value"></a><h3>How do I configure a session timeout value?</h3>
<p>You can configure a session timeout value for the platform, so that if a user is inactive for a specified period of time the user is automatically logged out.</p>
<p>Currently, you cannot change this setting via the user interface, but you can do it by running a database query. Replace the values in brackets below (remove the brackets also):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>{no-of-minutes}</strong>: replace with the session timeout value you want, in minutes. If the value is set to 0 (zero) there is no timeout; if it is set to 30, the session times out after 30 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>{tenant-id}</strong>: replace with your specific tenant ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>Update the values, and then run the following query on your database:</p>
<pre>update LOGIN_RULES set LOGIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT=<strong>{no-of-minutes}</strong> where TENANTID = (select TENANTID from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='<strong>{tenant-id}</strong>');</pre>

<p>For security reasons, you might want to disable the ability for users to change the email address associated with local accounts set up on the platform.</p>
<p>Currently, you cannot change this setting via the user interface, but you can do it in the database, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Table</strong>: BUSINESS_SECURITY_SETTINGS</li>
  <li><strong>Column name</strong>: USER_MODIFY_EMAIL</li>
</ul>

  <li> css style sheets</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Sprite files</li>
  <li>Site copy</li>

<a name="what_is_the_difference_between_resources_and_content"></a><h3>What's the difference between Resources and Content?</h3>
<p>When you log in as the Site Admin and go to the <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> section, you'll see two buttons to access File Manager:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Resources</strong>
  <p>The Resources button takes you to the /resources folder for your implementation. From here, you can upload files and create folders. Use this location for assets that do not require indexing, such as images and sprite files.</p>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: For site styles, use the Config &gt; Custom Styles option; see <a href="#i_want_to_customize_platform_styles">I want to customize platform styles. What do I do?</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Content</strong>
    <p>The Content button takes you to the /content folder for your implementation. Here, you can upload customized content files for the platform help and the platform legal agreement. You can also upload API documentation and API legal agreements, for any APIs already created on the platform. If you're uploading API documentation you'll need to know the APIID so that you choose the correct folder.</p>
    <p>Files uploaded to this location are indexed periodically, automatically, so that content is available for your site users when they use the Search feature to look for content.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> For more information on the file and folder structure for your implementation, as it relates to files you might want to upload or customize, see <a href="#what_is_the_folder_structure_for_content_default">What is the folder structure for content in Default Theme?</a> and <a href="#what_is_the_folder_structure_for_content_sd">What is the folder structure for content in Simple Developer Theme?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_the_folder_structure_for_content_default"></a><h3>What is the folder structure for content in Default Theme?</h3>
<p>If you're uploading content to the platform, via <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> &gt; <em>Content</em>, you'll need to make sure you place files in the correct folders.</p>
<p>Clicking the <strong>Content</strong> button takes you to File Manager where you can create folders, navigate up and down the folder structure, and upload single files or ZIP files. When you're uploading files, it's important to make sure you're in the right folder. You cannot move files.</p>
<p>The Content button takes you to the top level of the folder structure, the <strong>/content</strong> folder. From there, the folder structure is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>/api</strong>: top folder for any API documentation. When an API is added on the platform, a documentation folder is created. Click through to a specific API to upload API documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>/home</strong>: top folder for site content. From here there are additional subfolders:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>/landing</strong> for the site landing page and legal agreement (ideally HTML and PDF, but only one agreement)</li>
      <li><strong>/learnmore</strong> where the site content files are located.</li>
      <li><strong>/signup/confirm</strong> for the signup page.</li>
      <li><strong>/support</strong> for the support page and other content.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>For example, let's say you want to customize the Support page. The URL for the page is: {hostname}/#/home/support. You would go to <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> &gt; <em>Content</em>, to access the Content folder. In the File Explorer, click to navigate down to the home folder, then click to navigate down to the support folder. In this folder you will see index.htm which is the default page. To upload a replacement file, click <strong>Upload a File</strong> and navigate to the location of the new file.</p>
<p>If needed, you can save out the existing HTML; choose to view the file in the browser, click View Source, and then copy the HTML. Or you can export the fileset, which will include referenced assets.</p>

<a name="what_is_the_folder_structure_for_content_sd"></a><h3>What is the folder structure for content in Simple Developer Theme?</h3>
<p>The Simple Developer theme shares the same file and folder structure as Default Theme (see <a href="#what_is_the_folder_structure_for_content_default">What is the folder structure for content in Default Theme?</a> above), but uses different folders for content.</p>
<p>Simple Developer theme, by default, includes the following three content files/folders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documentation page: documentation/index.htm. In the user interface, this is accessed via the Documentation link at the center of the top menu bar.</li>
  <li>Help page: documentation/index.htm. In the user interface, this is accessed via the Help link, right of top menu bar.</li>
  <li>Welcome page: documentation/index.htm. In the user interface, this is accessed by clicking on the logo at the top left.</li>
  </ul>
<p>In the file system, these are represented by a structure of three subfolders in the main /content/ folder:</p>

<p>The Simple Developer theme shares the same file and folder structure as Default Theme, but uses different folders for content. If you want to replace existing content, you must mirror the existing folder structure, as given in <a href="#what_is_the_folder_structure_for_content_sd">What is the folder structure for content in Simple Developer Theme?</a> above.</p>
<p>When you navigate to the <strong>content</strong> folder in File Explorer, you won't see these subfolders and files. However, to update the content, you must use identical folder and file names. Create the folder, click into the folder, and then upload the revised file, as explained below.</p>
<h5>To update a Simple Developer default page</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in to the platform (Default Theme) as a Site Administrator.</li>
  <li>Go to <em>Administration</em> &gt; <em>Config &gt; Resources</em>.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Content</em> section, click <strong>File Manager</strong> to access the Content folder.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>New Directory</strong>, and create a folder with the exact name of the folder in which you want to update the content: for example, <strong>help</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click the new folder to go into it in File Explorer.</li>
  <li>Click Upload a File.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the location of the updated file and upload it. You can also upload a ZIP archive if you want to add multiple files or assets. <br />
    <strong>Note</strong>: 
    If you are uploading a ZIP file, make sure you're in the correct folder before uploading. The files are automatically unzipped as part of the upload process.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Upload</strong>. The file is uploaded.</li>
  <li>Test by viewing in Simple Developer theme.
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: to see the update immediately, you will need to clear cache and refresh the page. Cache is updated automatically every hour, so there is a delay before developers see the new page.</p></li>
</ol>

<a name="how_do_i_upload_style_sheets_to_the_developer_portal"></a><h3>How do I upload style sheets to the developer portal?</h3>
<p>When you upload a new custom.less file in the <em>Custom Styles</em> section, the /resources/theme/default/style directory is automatically created and includes the site default style sheets. Some points to note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>These style sheets cannot be updated using the upload process used for static content because the styles are regenerated each time a new <strong>custom.less</strong> style sheet is uploaded.</li>
  <li>If you want to add new styles to the platform, you must first download the template, custom_template.less, then rename it to custom.less, add the new styles to the custom.less file, and upload the modified file. When you upload the revised file in the Config section of the user interface, the new styles are added to the site as part of the rebuild process. For more information and detailed instructions, see <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_for_the_first_time">To customize platform styles for the first time</a>.</li>
  <li>Only a Site Administrator can update the platform style sheet.<br />

<a name="how_do_i_add_a_platform_signup_legal_agreement"></a><h3>How do I add a platform signup legal agreement?</h3>
<p>You might want to have a platform legal agreement in place, that all platform users will accept. If a legal agreement is in place, the platform requires users to accept the agreement as a precondition before completing the login process.</p>
<p>If there is an existing legal agreement in place, you must disable it before adding a new one. You can only have one. See <a href="#how_do_i_change_the_platform_signup_legal_agreement">How do I change the platform signup legal agreement?</a> below.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: The platform supports use of only one legal agreement. Make sure all the legal requirements are combined into one document.</p>

<h5>To add a platform legal agreement</h5>
<p>To add a legal agreement there are two steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, upload the legal agreement file. You can do this in the user interface. See <a href="#p_legal_agreement_upload">Step 1: To upload a new legal agreement via the Akana API Platform user interface</a> below.</li>
  <li>Then, make the new agreement the default for the platform. See <a href="#p_legal_agreement_specify">Step 2: To set a specific legal agreement as the default for the platform</a> below.</li>
</ol>
<h5><a name="p_legal_agreement_upload"></a>Step 1: To upload a new legal agreement to the platform</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Site Admin.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Resources</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Content</strong> section, click <strong>File Manager</strong> to access the /<strong>content</strong> folder.</li>
  <li>Navigate down to <strong>content/home/landing</strong>. If the folder structure doesn't exist, click <strong>New Directory</strong> to create a new subfolder, name it, and then click the new folder name to change directories down one level into the new one. Then create the next one until the folder structure exists and you are in the <strong>landing</strong> folder.
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure the folder naming, including sequence and capitalization, is exactly as above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Upload a File</strong>, navigate to the location of the new developer agreement, and upload it (for example, it could be a .txt, .htm, or .html file). The resulting path might be: <strong>content/home/landing/developeragreement.html</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
<p>Once you've uploaded the legal agreement, the next step is to make it the default for the platform. See below.</p>
<h5><a name="p_legal_agreement_specify"></a>Step 2: To set a specific legal agreement as the default for the platform</h5>
<p>Before setting the legal agreement as the default for the platform, you must upload it. See <strong>Step 1</strong> above.</p>
<p>The user interface does not currently support setting the default legal agreement for the platform, but you can do it via the API or by running a database script.</p>
<p>To use the API: in the Legals service, run the Create New Agreement operation (see <span class="apidoc_code"><a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/api/legals/m_legals_createNewAgreement.htm" target="_blank">POST&nbsp;/api/legals</a></span> on docs.akana.com). In the request body, put the applicable path and/or filename in the <strong>ContentPath</strong>, <strong>PrintContentPath</strong>, and <strong>FileName</strong> parameters.</p>
<p>Once the above two steps are completed successfully, any new users signing up for the platform are required to accept the agreement before continuing. Existing users are required to accept the legal agreement at next login.</p>

<a name="how_do_i_change_the_platform_signup_legal_agreement"></a><h3>How do I change the platform signup legal agreement?</h3>
<p>If you have a legal agreement in place, and want to change it, you must first deactivate the existing agreement by running a database script. Then, you can upload a new agreement following the instructions in <a href="#how_do_i_add_a_platform_signup_legal_agreement">How do I add a platform signup legal agreement?</a> above.</p>
<h5>To deactivate an existing legal agreement</h5>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: The queries below remove any existing legal agreements, so if you uploaded more than one by mistake, this script will fix it.</p>
<p>For a multi-tenant install, use the script below. Replace the {<strong>tenantid</strong>} placeholder with the Tenant ID for your installation. Note that line breaks have been added for display purposes. Your script should not have line breaks.</p>

If the folder structure doesn't exist, click <strong>New Directory</strong> to create a new subfolder, name it, and then click the new folder name to change directories down one level into the new one. Then create the next one until the folder structure exists and you are in the <strong>extensions</strong> folder.
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure the folder naming, including sequence and capitalization, is exactly as above.</p>
    </li>
  <li>If the folder structure already exists, and there is an <strong>init.js</strong> file in the <strong>extensions</strong> folder, download the file so you can modify it offline.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 2: Create or update the init.js file</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Do either of the following:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>If there is an existing init.js file</strong>: Modify the file you downloaded above, adding the lines of code given in <a href="#p_modifying_custom_file_init_js">Modifying the custom init.js file</a> below.</li>
      <li><strong>If there is no existing init.js file</strong>: Create the file and add the code as below.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Customize the <strong>init.js</strong> file to the required settings. For instructions, review the comments in the code.</li>
  </ol>
<p><strong>Step 3: Upload the customized init.js file</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>From the <strong>extensions</strong> folder, click <strong>Upload a File</strong>. Navigate to the location of your custom <strong>init.js</strong> file and upload the file. If you kept the theme name that is the default, it will look like this:
    <ul>
      <li> resources/theme/simpledev/SOA/Dev/extensions/init.js</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To update the browser, clear the cache and refresh the page. You might even need to close the browser and re-open to see the update.</li>
</ol>
<p>The default setting for the CORS policy, and the default behavior of Test Client with regard to whether the message is sent to the proxy or directly to the API endpoint, changes according to the value you specified in the <strong>init.js</strong> file. The file itself includes inline documentation.</p>

<h5><a name="p_modifying_custom_file_init_js"></a>Modifying the custom init.js file</h5>
<p>If no customizations were already added in your installation, this file will not exist in your file structure. In that case, you can create the file using the contents below. If the file already exists, you'll need to add the lines of code given below, and then customize as needed.</p>
<p>The code for the default CORS settings for Test Client is shown below. Inline documentation explains the settings you can change. There are two settings:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>allowOverride</strong>: <strong>true</strong> by default. If you change it to <strong>false</strong>, Test Client will not display the security settings dialog relating to the same origin policy, and therefore developers will not be able to change the setting.</li>
  <li><strong>defaultOption</strong>: <strong>cmForwardProxy</strong> by default, indicating that the message is sent by Test Client to the proxy and then forwarded to the API endpoint. If you change this setting to <strong>cors</strong>, indicating that the API is expected to support cross-origin resource sharing, the message is sent directly to the API endpoint; the forward proxy is not used.</li>
</ul>
<pre>SOA.Framework.Common.Map.config({

<h3><a name="where_download_metadata_json"></a>What are the metadata.json and widget_factory.json files, and how do I use them for customization?</h3>
<p>If you're performing UI customization tasks, you'll need to modify these files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>metadata.json</strong>: a file that describes the layout of the pages and the corresponding URL for each page. If there is no customization in place yet, <strong>metadata.json</strong> contains only a single pair of brackets: <strong>{}</strong>. For an example of customization, see <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/share/cm_customizing_ui.htm#metadata_json" title="link to customization content on Akana docs site" target="_blank">metadata.json</a> (Akana docs site).</li>
  <li><strong>widget_factory.json</strong>: A JSON file that describes the CanJS view corresponding to each widget in <strong>metadata.json</strong>. If there is no customization in place yet, <strong>widget_factory.json</strong> contains only a single pair of brackets: <strong>{}</strong>. For an example of customization, see <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/share/cm_customizing_ui.htm#widget_factory_json" title="link to customization content on Akana docs site" target="_blank">widget_factory.json</a> (Akana docs site).</li>
</ul>
<p>First create the files, and them upload them to the location shown below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>/resources/theme/default/SOA/CM/extensions/metadata.json</li>
  <li>    /resources/theme/default/SOA/CM/extensions/widget_factory.json</li>
</ul>
<h5>To upload the metadata.json and widget_factory.json files to the developer portal:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Site Admin.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Resources</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Resources</em> section, click <strong>File Manager</strong>.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the /resources/theme/default/SOA/CM/extensions directory. If the folder structure isn't there, create each folder in turn, go into it, and then create the next one until you have the structure. Make sure you get the capitalization exactly correct as shown here.</li>
  <li>In the /resources/theme/default/SOA/CM/extensions folder, upload <strong>metadata.json</strong> and <strong>widget_factory.json</strong>.</li>
  <li>Exit out of File Manager.<br />
  </li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="how_do_i_find_the_resource_version_key"></a>What is the Resource Version Key and how do I find it?</h3>
<p>UI resource files include all code-related components such as JavaScript files, templates, and stylesheets.</p>
<p>These types of files are cached for a long time, to improve performance, since generally the files do not change. The cache setting is one month.</p>
<p>For all resource files, the URL includes a dynamically-constructed unique ID, called a Resource Version Key.</p>
<p> If a new version of the platform resource files is uploaded, there is a new Resource Version Key. Because the URL is different, the next time the file is retrieved, the latest version replaces the older version. Therefore, a <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_cdn">CDN</a>, browser cache, forward proxy, etc. will need to make a new call to get the latest version. The change in the URL triggers the new call, and the updated resource is served.</p>
<p>The key is dynamically constructed every 10 minutes. This means that if you update a file, you won't see the change immediately. To see the update you'll need to do two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wait for 10 minutes to be sure the content is updated.</li>
  <li>Refresh the page so you'll see the change.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need to set up your platform version so that file updates are immediate, you'll need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you are not using any other components between the browser and the server, that might cache the file, such as a CDN, forward proxy, or reverse proxy.</li>
  <li>Clear the browser cache and refresh the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>The resource version key is used to construct the URL, but is not used when the request comes in. The server will always serve the latest file, independent of the version key specified in the URL. A request referencing an old version key will still get the new version in response.</p>

<h3><a name="h_configuration"></a>Configuration:</h3>



<a name="how_do_i_configure_separate_notification_addresses_by_theme"></a><h3>How do I configure separate notification addresses for different platform themes?</h3>
<p>The platform sends out email notifications to keep platform users informed about specific events&#8212;for example, password reset or changes to a team that the user is a member of. Some of these notifications include the platform URL; for example, the Welcome email includes the platform homepage URL for logging in.</p>
<p>If you have more than one theme configured for your platform installation, each theme has a separate URL. If a developer using your theme B forgets his password, the notification with the reset password link must include the URL for Theme B, not for Theme A. Therefore, you will need to take some extra steps so that, where applicable, the notifications triggered by activity on a specific theme use the correct URL for that theme.</p>
<p>Since the theme which by default we call Simple Dev has a simpler user interface and is focused on a developer audience, and the theme which we call Default Theme includes additional functionality, such as API and business management and Site Admin functions, notifications for roles more applicable to Default Theme are always sent out from the Default Theme URL. These roles include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Site Admin</li>
  <li>Business Admin</li>
  <li>API Admin</li>
</ul>
<p>Notifications for the following roles use a theme-specific URL:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anonymous user (not signed in as a platform user; for example, in a &quot;forgot password&quot; scenario)</li>
  <li>Developer</li>
  <li>App team member</li>
</ul>
<p>For a full list of roles and the types of notifications that are sent to each role, see <a href="site_admin_users.htm#what_are_the_user_roles_for_notifications">What are the user roles for notifications sent out from the platform?</a></p>
<p>When there are multiple themes configured for the tenant, you will need to run a script to load the TENANT_THEME_ROLES table and map the theme &gt; roles list. This table tells the platform which theme is used for which notifications.</p>
<p>In the NOTIFICATION_ROLES table, each notification template is mapped to the role that it is meant for. Before a notification is sent out, the tenant.console.address variable is replace with the theme-specific URL for the role that the specific notification template is mapped to.</p>
<p>In a few cases, multiple themes might be possible for the same notification. For example, a user of any theme might request a password reset. In this case, the platform uses the URL for the theme that caused the notification to be generated. The Forgot Password notification will include the address of the console for the theme in which the user initiated the Forgot Password request. In an upgrade scenario, or if the database modification to the TENANT_THEME_ROLES table, as below, has not been done, no themes will be mapped to any roles. In that case, we use the default theme assigned to the tenant.</p>
<p>The theme-specific feature cannot be configured in the user interface. Instead, you must run a database script. A template is shown below; this uses variable placeholders for theme name, role name, and tenant name.</p>

<pre>insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, '{theme}', '{rolename}' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='{tenant-name}';</pre>
<p>If there is only one tenant, you can omit the tenant name, like this:</p>
<pre>insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, '{theme}', '{rolename}' from TENANTS;
</pre>
<p>An example is shown below, using the theme names <strong>default</strong> and <strong>simpledev</strong>. In the below, substitute a value for the {tenant-name} variable or, if there is only one tenant, remove the <strong>where</strong> statement. If you are using different theme names, substitute the applicable values.</p>
<pre>insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'default', 'Anonymous User' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='{tenant-name}';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'default', 'ApiAdmin' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='{tenant-name}';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'default', 'BusinessAdmin' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='{tenant-name}';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'default', 'SiteAdmin' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='{tenant-name}';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'simpledev', 'User' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='{tenant-name}';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'simpledev', 'Anonymous User' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='{tenant-name}';
insert into TENANT_THEME_ROLES select TENANTID, 'simpledev', 'AppAdmin' from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='{tenant-name}';

<a name="what_is_the_csrf_prevention_feature"></a><h3>What is the CSRF prevention feature?</h3>
<p>The CSRF prevention feature adds a layer of protection against malicious <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_csrf_attack">CSRF</a> attacks, by means of a custom header.</p>
<p>A CSRF attack leverages the fact that the authorized user has already authenticated, and that the cookie is stored in the user's browser. The CSRF prevention feature requires an additional value to be sent as an extra header. If the extra header is not present, the request is rejected as unauthorized.</p>
<p>An authorized app developer can get the value from the cookie and compose and send the custom header with the request message.</p>
<p>The new header is the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_xcsrf_token_fedmemberidheader">X-Csrf-Token_fedmemberID</a> header. The app must take the value in the new Csrf-Token_fedmemberid cookie and send it as the value for the X-Csrf-Token_fedmemberID header in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All POST operations</li>
  <li>All PUT operations</li>
  <li>All DELETE operations  </li>
  <li>All GET operations <strong>except</strong> those in the following services/activities:
<ul>
      <li>Content upload and management</li>
      <li>Resource upload and management (such as avatars)</li>
      <li>Login</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>The <strong>Csrf-Token_fedmemberid</strong> cookie has the same timeout value as the <strong>AtmoAuthToken</strong> authorization cookie (as specified by the Site Admin, or 25 minutes by default).</p>
<p>For information on how to implement the CSRF prevention header, see <a href="#how_do_i_implement_csrf_prevention_feature">How do I implement the CSRF prevention feature?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_implement_csrf_prevention_feature"></a><h3>How do I implement the CSRF prevention feature?</h3>
<p>If you're concerned about malicious <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_csrf_attack">CSRF</a> attacks, make sure the CSRF prevention feature is in effect. This feature is turned on by default in new implementations, and turned off by default in existing implementations that upgrade to any version of the platform after version 7.1.3.</p>
<p>You can control CSRF prevention via the Business Security settings: see <a href="site_admin_settings.htm#how_do_i_configure_settings_for_security_business">How do I configure settings for business security?</a></p>
<p>If you already have a custom client, refer to <a href="#csrf_prevention_custom_client">I want CSRF prevention, but we already have a custom client. What do I do?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="csrf_prevention_custom_client"></a><h3>I want CSRF prevention, but we already have a custom client. What do I do?</h3>
<p>If your implementation includes the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_csrf_attack">CSRF</a> prevention feature, this requires all messages to POST, PUT, or DELETE operations to use the new <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_xcsrf_token_fedmemberidheader">X-Csrf-Token_fedmemberID</a> custom header.</p>
<p>However, if you already have a client that sends and receives messages to the Akana API Platform, when you implement the new feature, messages from the client will be refused because they don't have the custom header.</p>
<p>To support this feature in scenarios where there is an existing client that doesn't use the custom headers, there is a configuration setting you can use to specify that your client is a trusted sender and the custom header is not required. When the sending client is listed in this configuration setting, the messages are processed without the custom header.</p>
<p>In the configuration settings, under com.soa.atmosphere, choose atmosphere.config.csrfHttpWriteSkipUserAgents. This setting supports Network Director and federated Akana API Platform scenarios invoking Akana API Platform APIs without having to send the CSRF token.</p>
<p>For more information about accessing and modifying this setting, see <a href="site_admin_admin_console_settings.htm#ac_settings_cm_navigation">How do I get to the Akana API Platform Configuration Settings in the Akana Administration Console?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_configure_security_challenge_questions"></a><h3>How do I configure security challenge questions?</h3>
<p>The platform includes a feature whereby you can configure security challenge questions to be offered to user signing up.</p>
<p>By default, a user signing up is asked to answer three questions. The user's answers are stored securely in the database and the questions/answers are used as additional security for certain sensitive operations, such as when the user requests a password reset.</p>
<p>Later, as part of managing the user profile, the user can modify answers to existing questions, or can choose one or more different questions from the list provided and then answer the new questions.</p>
<p>In some cases, the user's answer might not be displayed, depending on the site's security settings.</p>
<p>The Site Admin can choose from certain questions that are set up by default, to be offered to users, or can compose different questions.</p>
<p>This feature adds another layer of security for the user's account.</p>
<p>Site Admin management of this feature is not currently available via the user interface. You can do this in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By a database script. For more information, <a href="basics_support.htm#how_do_i_contact_technical_support">contact Technical Support</a>.</li>
  <li>Using the API: via the Save Challenges operation in the Businesses service. For more information, refer to <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/api/businesses/m_businesses_saveChallenges.htm" target="_blank">the API documentation for the <span class="apidoc_code">PUT&nbsp;/api/businesses/{BusinessID}/challenges</span> operation at docs.akana.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you add security questions and later replace them with different ones, the older questions are maintained in the database since user might have set up answers to those questions. In this case, they are set to Inactive in the database (ACTIVE=N) since they are no longer in active use.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_enable_markdown_for_board_items"></a><h3>How do I enable Markdown for board items?</h3>
<p>The platform supports the use of Markdown to add rich text formatting, inline images, and downloadable files in user-generated board entries.</p>
<p>If enabled, Markdown is supported for discussions, tickets, alerts, reviews, and comments.</p>
<p>For each type of board item that supports Markdown, there are two configurable settings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Markdown Support</li>
  <li>External Link Support</li>
</ul>
<h5>To enable Markdown for discussions, tickets, alerts, reviews, or comments:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Site Admin and click the <em>Administration</em> quick filter (wrench icon).</li>
  <li>On the left menu, click Settings.</li>
  <li>Choose the type of setting:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alerts</strong>. For more information, see <a href="site_admin_settings.htm#how_do_i_configure_settings_for_alerts">How do I configure settings for alerts?</a></li>

    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>On the <strong>Markdown Support</strong> field, click <strong>Enabled</strong>.
<p>This enables the use of Markdown to add formatting such as heading styles, bold and italics, tables, and lines. It also allows image upload for the display of inline images, and file upload so that the content can include a link to a downloadable file.</p></li>
    <li>On the <strong>External Link Support</strong> field, click <strong>Enabled</strong> (or leave as Disabled).
    <p>This enables the use of external links in Markdown. It's only applicable if Markdown support is enabled. One application of this setting is to restrict links to external sites for security reasons, by leaving external link support disabled, while allowing formatting and uploaded files by enabling the Markdown setting.</p></li>
    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<a name="how_do_i_monitor_app_security_changes"></a><h3>I need to monitor app security changes. What do I do?</h3>
<p>By default, whenever an app developer makes a significant change to app credentials, the user is required to enter a comment regarding the action being done. A notification is posted to the app's Board regarding the action, the user performing the action, and the user's comment. This acts as an audit trail which you can also access via the database.</p>
<p>Comments are collected, and Board items generated, for the following events relating to app security:</p>
<ul>
  <li>App Shared Secret is regenerated.</li>
  <li>Credentials are uploaded.</li>
  <li>Credentials are modified.</li>
  <li>Credentials are removed.</li>

<h3 style="color: gray;"><a name="h_cookies">Cookies:</a></h3>



<a name="does_the_developer_portal_use_cookies_siteadmin"></a><h3>Does the developer portal use cookies?</h3>
<p>Yes. The developer portal uses two main  cookies:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Session authorization cookie (AtmoAuthToken)</strong>
    <p>When a user logs in, an authorization cookie is sent, and is stored in the browser for the duration of the user's session. The session cookie is renewed as long as the session remains active, and is refreshed if the information stored in the cookie, such as the user's permission information, changes. It is removed when the user logs out. If the user does not log out, it expires after 30 minutes of inactivity. If the user closes the browser, the cookie remains valid until the 30-minute expiration time; if the user opens the browser again within this time, and resumes the session, the cookie remains valid. If the browser is closed for 30 minutes the cookie expires.</p></li>
  <li><strong>CSRF prevention cookie (Csrf-Token)</strong>
<p>Like the AtmoAuthToken cookie, the CSRF prevention cookie is set at login. It is used only if the CSRF prevention feature is in use. The platform provides this cookie as an additional safeguard against CSRF attacks. Like the authorization cookie, it is stored in the browser for the duration of the user's session. It is renewed if the AtmoAuthToken cookie is renewed. The CSRF prevention cookie has the same expiration time as the AtmoAuthToken cookie. For more information, see <a href="#what_is_the_csrf_prevention_feature">What is the CSRF prevention feature?</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>A key difference between these two cookies is that the AuthToken cookie is set with the HttpOnly option, meaning that JavaScript cannot read this cookie; the CSRF token cookie does not use the HttpOnly option, because the JavaScript must be able to read this cookie when making <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_ajax">Ajax</a> calls from the browser.</p>
<p><strong>Local browser storage</strong></p>
<p>In addition,  the developer portal uses a local storage field in the browser, <strong>touch</strong>, to store the timestamp that's used to manage the inactive session timeout feature in scenarios where the user might have two browser tabs open at the same time. This is true for the following browser versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer version 8 and later</li>
  <li>Chrome</li>
  <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other cookies that are used in different parts of the developer portal user interface very briefly as a way to pass information from one page to another. For more information, see <a href="#does_the_developer_portal_use_any_other_cookies">Does the developer portal use any cookies other than the session and CSRF cookies?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="will_the_portal_work_properly_if_cookies_are_disabled"></a><h3>Will the developer portal work properly if cookies are disabled?</h3>
<p>If cookies are disabled, anonymous users can still access the portal, but none of the functionality that is available only to users who are logged in will be available. This includes activities such as adding, modifying, and deleting apps and APIs, creating contracts, creating or joining groups, and commenting on discussions.</p>
<p>The session cookie  (AtmoAuthToken) includes information on the user's roles, and the resources the user has access to, so it is necessary for the full functionality of the developer portal.</p>
<p>The Site Admin can turn off the CSRF prevention feature in the security settings (Administration &gt; Settings &gt; Security); in this case, the Csrf-Token cookie is not used. However, turning off this security feature is not recommended.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_information_is_in_the_cookies"></a><h3>What information is contained in the cookies and what is it used for?</h3>
<p>The session cookie includes information on the roles and permissions that have been granted to the user. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whether the user is a Site Admin or Business Admin.</li>
  <li>Whether the user is an API Admin for one or more APIs, and if so which ones.</li>
  <li>Whether the user is an app team member for one or more apps, and if so which ones.</li>
  <li>Groups the user is a member of, and the membership role if applicable (Admin, Leader, or Member, for independent platform groups).</li>
  <li>Resources the user is following.</li>
</ul>
<p>The session cookie determines which resources the user can see and can modify, based on the user's role and permissions as above.</p>
<p>The Csrf-Token cookie is used only as an additional mechanism that can be used to help prevent a CSRF attack. When adding, changing, or deleting platform resources, the CSRF-header is needed; the CSRF-Token is used in composing the CSRF header. For more information, see <a href="#what_is_the_csrf_prevention_feature">What is the CSRF prevention feature?</a> The CSRF settings can be turned off; in this case, the Csrf-Token cookie is not used.</p>

<a name="does_the_developer_portal_store_peristent_cookies_in_the_browser"></a><h3>Does the developer portal store persistent cookies in the browser?</h3>
<p>No. Both the cookies that the developer portal uses are session cookies. They are removed when the session ends or times out.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="does_the_developer_portal_send_cookies_to_other_sites"></a><h3>Does the developer portal send cookies to other sites?</h3>
<p>No. The developer portal uses its own cookies, as covered in <a href="#does_the_developer_portal_use_cookies_siteadmin">Does the developer portal use cookies?</a> above. It does not send cookies to other sites.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="does_the_developer_portal_use_any_other_cookies"></a><h3>Does the developer portal use any cookies other than the session and CSRF cookies?</h3>
<p>The main cookies that the developer portal uses are the session and CSRF cookies, as covered in <a href="#does_the_developer_portal_use_cookies_siteadmin">Does the developer portal use cookies?</a> above.</p>
<p>However, the portal also uses cookies very briefly with certain features, in the following scenarios:</p>

  <li><strong>Test Client with OAuth Policy</strong>
    <p>If you are using <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_testclient">Test Client</a> with OAuth policy, there is a cookie used in the Test Client feature that is set in the main page of the user interface so that it can be read in a popup window. It is deleted as soon as it has been read in the popup window. The platform does this to work around browser-enforced security, since the OAuth provider is usually from a different URL than the developer portal URL. This cookie is live in Test Client only for a very short time, probably a few milliseconds. The cookie name is <strong>oauthRedirectInfoCookie</strong>.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Third-Party Login with Google and Facebook (not LDAP)</strong>
    <p>If you are using a third party such as Google or Facebook for login (not LDAP login), when the  user logs into the portal for the first time, the portal uses a transient cookie to exchange information between the SSO login page and the signup page, in order to complete the signup page. This cookie stays live only for a very short time, probably a few milliseconds.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the platform is configured for Google Analytics integration, there will be additional cookies that are used by Google Analytics. Google Analytics integration is configured in the database. To turn it on: in the <strong>TENANTS</strong> table, set the value of the <strong>ANALYTICSACCOUNTID</strong> column to your Google Analytics account ID. To turn it off: set this value to <strong>null</strong>. Google Analytics cookies are prefixed with __utm.</p>
