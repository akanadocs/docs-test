<a name="what_is_test_client"></a><h3>What is Dev Console / Test Client?</h3>
<p>The platform includes a Dev Console interface that acts as an easy-to-use test client for any API that is fully integrated, with an API definition in the platform. This test tool allows developers to thoroughly test all capabilities of the API.</p>
<p>It can be used  for prototyping, testing, and troubleshooting apps against an API. It includes OAuth support for retrieving the OAuth token in order to process the message.</p>
<p>In Default Theme, the tool is called Dev Console; in Simple Developer Theme, it is called Test Client.</p>
<p>As an API admin, it's a good idea to try your API out in Test Client before you publish, so you can see what experience app developers will have when trying out your API.</p>

<a name="how_do_i_access_test_client"></a><h3>How do I access Dev Console / Test Client?</h3>
<p>Test Client is available in two places, one for app developers and one for API admins:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For app developers: From the App Details page, choose Test Client or choose Dev Console.</li>
  <li>For API Admins: You'll need to construct the URL. See below.</li>
</ul>
<h5>To construct the Simple Developer URL for an API Test Client:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Take your Simple Developer platform URL, up to and including the #! in the URL, but delete everything after that.</li>
  <li>Get your APIID and APIVersion ID. If necessary, you can get these from Default Theme by going to the API Details page (APIID is shown in the URL) and clicking Edit (APIVersion ID is added to the URL).</li>
  <li>Construct the URL by adding the following after the portion of the URL that you already have:
    <p>apis/&lt;APIID&gt;/versions/&lt;APIVersionID&gt;/testclient</p>
  <p>For example, the URL might be:</p>
  <p><strong>http://{hostname}/#!apis/9add5c43-d9c8-443c-b13f-5388eaf95df8.acmepaymentscorp/versions/f9c0846f-c4b5-4a42-b759-2f92de62aaa4.acmepaymentscorp/testclient</strong></p>
</li>
  <li>Paste the URL in the address bar and click <strong>Enter</strong> to go to the Test Client page for your API in Simple Developer theme. You can now put in sample values to test your API.</li>
</ol>

<a name="how_do_i_test_my_api_in_test_client"></a><h3>How do I test my API in Dev Console / Test Client?</h3>
<p>To test your API in Test Client, you can access it as an app developer or as an API admin. For instructions, see <a href="#how_do_i_access_test_client">How do I access Dev Console / Test Client?</a> above.</p>
<p>As an API admin, it's a good idea to test:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With a few different operations</li>
  <li>With different parameters and headers</li>
  <li>With each of the security mechanisms your API supports</li>
  <li>With each OAuth version, and grant type, your API supports</li>
  <li>With each token type your API support.</li>
</ul>
<p>For general info on the settings available, and where different values are set up, refer to the app developer help, reference section: <a href="app_test.htm#field_values_test_client">Test Client: Configuration Values</a>.</p>
