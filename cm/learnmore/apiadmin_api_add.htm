<h2 id="create_api_overview">Add API: Overview</h2>
<p>The Akana API Platform leads you through a simple, streamlined process for adding an API. It goes like this:</p>
<p><img src="assets/process_api_create.gif" alt="Create API process" /></p>
<p>For information about how to complete each of these steps, refer to:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Design</strong>: <a href="apiadmin_api_design.htm">Add or Modify an API Using API Designer</a></li>
	<li><strong>Implement</strong>: <a href="apiadmin_implementations.htm">Manage API Implementations</a></li>
	<li><strong>Test</strong>: <a href="api_admin_testing_tc.htm">API Testing with Test Client</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to create your API by importing an API description document such as a Swagger document, the process is even more streamlined:</p>
<p><img src="assets/process_api_create_import.gif" alt="Create API using description document" /></p>
<p>To get started, see <a href="#add_api">How do I add an API?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="create_api_processflow">Add API: Process Flow</h2>
<p>The process flow is a little different depending on how you add the API. For more information and process flow diagrams, choose the applicable link below:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#process_flow_add_api_design_from_scratch">What is the process flow to add an API by designing from scratch?</a></li>
	<li><a href="#process_flow_add_api_using_a_d_d">What is the process flow to add an API using an API description document?</a></li>
	<li><a href="#process_flow_add_api_from_service">What is the process flow to add an API from an existing service?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="add_api">How do I add an API?</h2>
<p>To add a complete API definition on the platform, you'll need to provide information about the API: either manually, by uploading an API description document, or by referencing an API already set up in the underlying infrastructure (API Gateway).</p>
<p>To get started immediately, you can simply name your API and save. You can go back and add more information later.</p>
<h4>To get started adding an API (minimum steps)</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Click the plus sign <strong>(+)</strong> in the middle of the top menu bar, and choose <strong>Add a New API</strong>.</li>
	<li>Optional: click the advanced options icon on the right, and choose a different implementation pattern. Proxy is the default, but you can also choose <strong>Orchestration</strong> or <strong>Physical Service</strong>. See <a href="#add_api_pattern">What is the API pattern and which pattern should I choose?</a></li>
	<li>Specify a name for the API, and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can add the rest of the information later.</p>
<p>Probably, you'll want to be prepared with information about your API, so that you can set up all the information the platform needs, and you can then test. You have three choices:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Design a REST API from scratch</strong>: manually provide all the information about the API, including operations, parameters, headers, and so forth. See <a href="#add_api_from_scratch">How do I add an API by designing from scratch?</a></li>
	<li><strong>Provide an API description document</strong>. The platform reads in the information, and you can then review (if you want to) and save. See <a href="#add_api_using_a_d_d">How do I add an API using an API description document?</a> For supported formats, see <a href="#what_types_of_a_d_d">What types of API description document can I use to define my API?</a></li>
	<li>Create an API from an existing service: reference the existing service. The platform reads the information and creates the API, and you can then review (if you want to) and save. See <a href="#add_api_from_service">How do I add an API from an existing service?</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: In some cases, if an extension is in place, additional fields might appear in the bottom section of the <strong>Add API</strong> page. If so, these additional fields collect information about your API. Fields might be required or optional and might be of various types such as text-based or numeric, multiple selection, or dates. If you have questions about any of these fields, check the in-page tooltip (question mark to the right of the field) for help.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="what_info_do_i_need_to_add_an_api_from_scratch">What information do I need to add an API from scratch?</h2>
<p>You can create an API with just the name, then save it and add the rest later. </p>
<p>To complete the task, if you're adding a REST API from scratch, you'll need to be ready with the exact information for the API definition.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the exact spelling/wording, where applicable.</p>
<p>The specific information you'll need depends on your specific API, its definition and its level of complexity.</p>
<h4>Ideal:</h4>
<p>To provide full details of your API, that will enable your users to take full advantage of the rich features of Test Client and ensure your API's generated documentation is really complete and useful, you'll need to provide exact details of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Operation definitions, including HTTP verb and URL</li>
	<li>Parameters</li>
	<li>Request headers</li>
	<li>Request and response media types</li>
	<li>Responses, including HTTP code and description</li>
	<li>Model object definitions that are sent in the request and response</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also specify additional information about your API in the <strong>Advanced Options</strong> section on the right. See <a href="#api_add_advanced_options">What information should I specify in the Advanced Options?</a></p>

<h4>Bare minimum:</h4>
<p>If you don't provide all of the above, your users will be missing out on the features of Test Client and the generated documentation. However, your API will still work as long as you provide the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>URL path</li>
	<li>HTTP verb</li>
	<li>Request media types</li>
	<li>Response media types</li>
</ul>
<p>If you start defining your API and find you don't have all the information to hand, don't worry. You can save your work and come back to it later.</p>

<h2 id="process_flow_add_api_design_from_scratch">What is the process flow to add an API by designing from scratch?</h2>
<p><strong>Video content</strong>: <a href="https://www.akana.com/video-tutorials/develop-your-api" title="Learn how to use Akana to easily create an API from scratch or from a file import (OAS3/Swagger/RAML/WSDL/WADL)." target="_blank">Learn how to use Akana to easily create an API from scratch or from a file import (OAS3/Swagger/RAML/WSDL/WADL).</a></p>
<p>When you choose to add an API, and you don't have an API description document, you can define your API from scratch using the API Designer.</p>
<p>To fully design the API, you'll need to have your API documentation or other source of information handy so that you define the API accurately.</p>
<p>In API Designer, you can add operations, parameters, and media types, model objects, and any other information that's part of your API definition. For details, see <a href="apiadmin_api_design.htm">Add or Modify an API Using API Designer</a>.</p>
<p>Once that's done, you can create one or more implementations, add policy assignments, verify the access points, and test. The process flow is shown below.</p>

<p><strong>Video content</strong>: <a href="https://www.akana.com/video-tutorials/develop-your-api" title="Learn how to use Akana to easily create an API from scratch or from a file import (OAS3/Swagger/RAML/WSDL/WADL)." target="_blank">Learn how to use Akana to easily create an API from scratch or from a file import (OAS3/Swagger/RAML/WSDL/WADL).</a></p>
<p>To add an API from scratch, it's best to first gather the information about the API definition. See <a href="#what_info_do_i_need_to_add_an_api_from_scratch">What information do I need to add an API from scratch?</a> above. You can save the API definition at any point, and come back to it later.</p>
<h4>To add an API by designing from scratch</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Akana API Platform.</li>
	<li>Go to <strong>APIs</strong> &gt; <strong>Add API</strong>. The <strong>Add API</strong> page opens.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>I want to design my API from scratch (REST only)</strong> button.</li>
	<li>Provide a name for the API, and the endpoint if you have it already.</li>
	<li>Optional: click the <strong>Advanced Options</strong> slider button (blue dot) and specify additional settings. See <a href="#api_add_advanced_options">What information should I specify in the Advanced Options?</a></li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The platform saves the data and takes you to the API Designer for adding details about your API, including:
		<ul>
			<li>Adding resources: see <a href="apiadmin_api_design.htm#operation_add">How do I add a resource in API Designer?</a></li>
			<li>Adding parameters for operations: see <a href="apiadmin_api_design.htm#api_designer_parameter_add_edit">How do I add or edit a parameter for an API operation?</a></li>
			<li>Adding responses for operations: see <a href="apiadmin_api_design.htm#api_designer_define_response">How do I define my API response?</a></li>
			<li>Specifying media types: see <a href="apiadmin_api_design.htm#api_designer_media_types_set_up">How do I set up media types in API Designer?</a></li>
			<li>Adding model object definitions: see <a href="apiadmin_api_design.htm#model_object_add">How do I assign a model object to a resource in API Designer?</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When done, remember to click <strong>Save</strong> on the API Designer window, to save your API design.</li>
	</ol>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: In some cases, if an extension is in place, additional fields might appear in the bottom section of the <strong>Add API</strong> page. If so, these additional fields collect information about your API. Fields might be required or optional and might be of various types such as text-based or numeric, multiple selection, or dates. If you have questions about any of these fields, check the in-page tooltip (question mark to the right of the field) for help.</p>
<p>For more information about API Designer, see <a href="apiadmin_api_design.htm">Add or Modify an API Using API Designer</a>.</p>
<p>When your API design is complete, remember to test your API, using Test Client, to make sure it's working properly. See <a href="api_admin_testing_tc.htm">API Testing with Test Client</a>.</p>
<p>If you need to change something later, you can edit the API definition as needed.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="what_types_of_a_d_d">What types of API description document can I use to define my API?</h2>
<p>Version 2020.1.0 and later: For details about the API description document formats and versions supported, refer to the System Requirements documentation. Go to <a href="../../sp/system_requirements/system_requirements_all.htm">System Requirements (all versions)</a> and choose your version. Then, go to the <strong>API description document formats</strong> section.</p>
<p>The information below is for version 2019.1.x.</p>
<p>The platform supports adding an API by uploading, or otherwise referencing, API description documents in any of the following formats:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For REST APIs:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_oas30">OAS 3.0</a></li>

<h2 id="process_flow_add_api_using_a_d_d">What is the process flow to add an API using an API description document?</h2>
<p>When you choose to add a new API, you can then define your API by providing an API description document. The platform pulls all the information from the API description document and creates the API design and a Live implementation. You just need to add another implementation if needed, add or modify policy assignments, verify the access points, and test, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/Workflow_AddAPI_a_d_d.gif" alt="Add API: from API description document" /></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="add_api_using_a_d_d">How do I add an API using an API description document?</h2>
<p>To add an API using an API description document, first get the document, or make sure you know its location:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>URL</strong>: an individual API description document. Make sure you have the full URL, with authentication credentials if needed.</li>
	<li><strong>File</strong>: an individual API description document file or a ZIP archive file containing one or more API description documents. Make sure the file is accessible on the local filesystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the steps below.</p>
<h4>To add an API using an API description document</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Akana API Platform.</li>
	<li>Click the plus sign <strong>(+)</strong> in the middle of the top menu bar, and choose <strong>Add a New API</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose <strong>Add a new API</strong>, and then click the <strong>I have an OAS3/Swagger/RAML/WSDL/WADL document</strong> button. There are two ways you can provide the API definition:
		<ul>
		<li><strong>URL</strong>: Provide the full URL, including protocol. If the URL requires authentication, provide your username and password (for Authentication Options, the default is Anonymous).
		<p><strong>Note</strong>: Depending on the platform settings, you might not be able to upload from a URL that isn't trusted. If you see an error message or a 403 Forbidden response, contact the Site Admin, who can add the URL to the trusted list. See <a href="site_admin_site.htm#limit_forward_proxy">Limit forward proxy feature to allow only these hosts</a> (Site Admin help).</p></li>
			<li><strong>File</strong>: Browse to the location of the file and upload. If the file includes multiple services, you'll be shown a list of options for the service to import; choose the one you want.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The API is created, and the API's <strong>Overview</strong> page is displayed.</li>
</ol>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: In some cases, if an extension is in place, additional fields might appear in the bottom section of the <strong>Add API</strong> page. If so, these additional fields collect information about your API. Fields might be required or optional and might be of various types such as text-based or numeric, multiple selection, or dates. If you have questions about any of these fields, check the in-page tooltip (question mark to the right of the field) for help.</p>
<p>When you create an API from an API description document, the platform automatically creates a Live implementation. You'll need to review the implementation and, probably, add <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy">policies</a>. Optionally, you can also add a Sandbox implementation. For information about implementations, see <a href="apiadmin_implementations.htm">Manage API Implementations</a>.</p>
<p>When you're done, remember to test your API, using Test Client, to make sure it's working properly. See <a href="api_admin_testing_tc.htm">API Testing with Test Client</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="process_flow_add_api_from_service">What is the process flow to add an API from an existing service?</h2>
<p>When you specify an existing service, the platform pulls all the information already set up in the underlying infrastructure (API Gateway). You just need to add another implementation if needed, add or modify policy assignments, verify the access points, and test, as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/Workflow_AddAPI_existingservice.gif" alt="Add API: from existing service" /></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="add_api_from_service">How do I add an API from an existing service?</h2>
<p>If you already have an API that's set up as a service in the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_api_gateway">API Gateway</a>, or you want to create the service using the flexible service definition model offered by the API Gateway, you can use the <strong>Publish an existing service as an API</strong> option to add the API to the platform.</p>
<p>The platform references the information already set up in the API Gateway so you don't have to set up all the API details again.</p>
<p>You might choose this option if your service matches any of the following descriptions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A virtual service that is an aggregate of different target services.</li>
	<li>A virtual service that is implemented using an orchestration engine.</li>
	<li>Any service that supports multiple interfaces and bindings.</li>
	</ul>
<h4>To add an API from an existing API Gateway service</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Click the plus sign <strong>(+)</strong> in the middle of the top menu bar, and choose <strong>Add a New API</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose <strong>Publish an existing service as an API</strong> and click <strong>Add</strong>. A wizard opens and displays at the first page, <strong>Details</strong>.</li>
	<li>Specify basic API details: <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Description</strong>, <strong>Visibility</strong>, <strong>Version ID</strong>, and <strong>Version Description</strong>.</li>
	<li>Check the box to indicate whether the API uses licenses.
		<p>For more information about setting up an API to use licenses, see <a href="apiadmin_manage_licensing.htm#api_licensing">How do I determine what licenses will be available for my API?</a> For general information about the Licenses feature, see <a href="ov_licenses.htm">Licenses: Feature Overview</a>.</p></li>
	<li>Optional: set up an avatar for your API. Click <strong>Upload</strong> and navigate to the avatar image file.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to go to the <strong>Target API</strong> page.</li>
	<li>Set up the following values for at least one environment in which the API is running:
		<ul>
	<li><strong>Service Key</strong>. Enter the environment name, unique service key, or URL. The platform locates the API Gateway service, and you can then select it. To locate the appropriate value, go to the API Gateway, open up the service, and click <strong>Edit</strong>. Copy the value and paste it into this field.</li>
	<li><strong>Allow <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_anonymousaccess">anonymous access</a></strong> (yes/no)</li>
			<li><strong>Approval required</strong> (yes/no)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: In some cases, if an extension is in place, additional fields might appear in the bottom section of the <strong>Add API</strong> page. If so, these additional fields collect information about your API. Fields might be required or optional and might be of various types such as text-based or numeric, multiple selection, or dates.

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>


<h2 id="a_d_d_upload_zip">Can I upload my API description in a ZIP file?</h2>
<p>Yes. The file you upload can be an individual file or a ZIP file. However, you can only upload a ZIP file that's on your local filesystem, not via a URL.</p>
<p>If it is a ZIP file, it might include multiple services in one format; for example, several Swagger 2.0 documents. It might include a mix of Swagger versions, or a mix of different types of API description documents; for example, WADL and RAML or Swagger 2.0 and WSDL. If the file includes descriptions of more than one service, the platform displays a list of services so that you can choose the service to import for your API definition, as shown below.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="api_add_advanced_options">What information should I specify in the Advanced Options?</h2>
<p>When you're adding an API, the basic information that you need to specify is covered by the fields on the left side of the page.</p>
<p>There are additional values that you usually won't need to change, that you can specify on the right side of the page. These options are not visible unless you click the <strong>Advanced Options</strong> slider button (blue dot), as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/api_add_advanced_options.png" alt="Add API, Advanced Options" /></p>
<p>If you need to edit the API properties, you can access the same properties on the <strong>Edit API</strong> page, right side. To get there: from the <strong>API Details</strong> page, at the top right, click <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>


<h4 id="api_advanced_options">API Advanced Options</h4>

	<li>For a simple API that just references one endpoint, leave at the default, <strong>Proxy</strong>.
		<p>In a proxy scenario, the API Implementation has a 1:1 relationship with a corresponding back-end Physical Service/API. The back-end Physical Service/API shares the same design as the API itself. A common use case is a scenario where you might want the platform to manage an existing API. In this scenario, you create a proxy and specify the existing API endpoint. The platform creates an API Implementation, automatically registers the appropriate back-end Physical Service/API, and creates default processes that tie each operation of the API Implementation to the appropriate back-end operation. The platform then provides a new (proxied) API endpoint that you can use and share for API access.</p>
	</li>
	<li>For a more complex API implementation, that might include one or more services, processes, or additional steps, choose <strong>Orchestration</strong>.
		<p>In an orchestration scenario, you design the API and then manually build a mashup or orchestration for each operation of each implementation. You are free to call any number of other back-end Services/APIs in the orchestration. Unlike a proxy, where the platform automatically registers a back-end Physical Service/API and generates a default process for every operation, the orchestration simply creates an empty process. You can then edit each operation in turn and decide what kind of process you want and which back-end Services/APIs you want to invoke.</p>
		<p>An orchestration creates a service that is implemented with a process, rather than being simply a proxy of another service. If the API has an implementation pattern of Orchestration, you can access the Process Editor to manage the process for a specific operation by clicking through for that specific operation, at the bottom of the page for the specific implementation. This feature offers many additional capabilities for orchestrating processes relating to the API. For more information, see <a href="apiadmin_implementations.htm#api_impl_process_editor">How do I manage orchestration for my implementation?</a></p>
		<p>For a tutorial video on orchestration, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdiYPH4YP0A" target="_blank">Add an API using orchestration</a> (external link).</p>
	</li>
	<li>If you want to set up an external API so that you can reference it in a script or process for an API that uses orchestration, or you're adding an API that already exists as a physical service in the underlying infrastructure, Policy Manager, choose <strong>Physical Service</strong>. For information about adding an API as a physical service, see <a href="apiadmin_api_phys_svc.htm">Working with Physical Services</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Once you've chosen an implementation pattern and created the API, you can't change the pattern. If you need a different implementation pattern, you'll need to delete the API and then create it with the correct implementation pattern.</p>

<p>When you add an API, default values are assigned, unless you specify values in the Advanced Options. For information on the defaults and the options, see <a href="#api_advanced_options">API Advanced Options</a>.</p>
<p>In some cases, you might want to specify the implementation/deployment zones. For example, you might want to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Start with a Sandbox implementation, and release the API in a Live implementation later.</li>
	<li>Choose on or more specific deployment zones that the API will be deployed to.</li>
</ul>
<p> You can specify these additional values in the Advanced Options when you're adding the API. Follow the steps below.</p>

<h2 id="add_api_soap">How do I add a SOAP-based API?</h2>
<p>If your API is SOAP-based, make sure you have the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_wsdl">WSDL</a> available; either a WSDL URL or an individual file or ZIP file.</p>
<p>Then, create your API following the procedure in <a href="#add_api_using_a_d_d">How do I add an API using an API description document?</a> above.</p>
<p>When you add an API based on a WSDL file, the summary of description languages displayed in the Implementations section at the bottom of the API Details page and the API Design page lists only WSDL, as shown below (Hermosa theme); you cannot view the API description in other API description languages such as Swagger and RAML, as you can for REST-based APIs.</p>

<p>When you add the API initially, the first version is created automatically.</p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you add a new version, in most cases you can choose a different implementation pattern.

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>


<h2 id="api_anonymous_access">Should I allow anonymous access?</h2>
<p>The <strong>Allow Anonymous Access</strong> option lets you enable or disable anonymous access to Sandbox and Live endpoints.</p>
<p>Allowing anonymous access to an API endpoint in a Sandbox implementation is useful if you want to offer a preview of an API to developers without requiring users to create an app or sign up to the platform. For example, if you have a specific feature set that you want to expose as part of promoting your API, you can expose those operations in your API configuration, and enable the Allow Anonymous Access option.</p>
<p>With anonymous access, developers can review your API documentation and try out the API without signing up and requesting access. If a developer tries out the API and likes it, he/she can then sign up, create an app on the platform, and request API access.</p>
<p>Your decision will depend on many factors including the nature of your app and your target audience.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you do <strong>not</strong> allow anonymous access to a Live implementation for security reasons. However, allowing anonymous access to a Sandbox implementation means that app developers can easily try out your API without having to set up an app on the platform.</p>
<p>Note that with anonymous access, viewing of metrics such as charts and logs is not supported.</p>
<p>To change this setting on an API, see <a href="apiadmin_implementations.htm#proc_impl_edit">To edit an API implementation</a> (Step 4).</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="api_approval_required">Should I require approval for API access requests?</h2>
<p>Requiring approval for API access requests introduces a delay for app developers, but gives you the chance for manual intervention and gives you greater control.</p>
<p>One approach is to allow anonymous access, with no approval required, for a Sandbox implementation, but to require approval for access to a Live implementation.</p>
<p>In some cases, you might decide that even though you are allowing anonymous access to a Sandbox implementation, you'll still require approval for an API access contract. If the API allows anonymous access, app developers can access it without connecting the app to the API; however, unless there is a connection contract, the API doesn't show up in the app's Test Client for testing. For this reason, app developers might prefer not to take advantage of the anonymous access, but to request a contract instead, so that your API is available for selection in Test Client.</p>
<p>Even in this scenario, you might choose to allow anonymous access to the Sandbox implementation, not require approval for contracts in the Sandbox implementation, but require approval for contracts in the Live implementation. App developers could then request a contract in the Sandbox environment and would get immediate access to your API.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>




<h2 id="what_is_a_proxy_api">Why would I use the platform to proxy my API?</h2>
<p>When you set up your API on the platform, using the platform as a proxy, your API is the Target API and the platform is the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_proxyapi">Proxy API</a>. This allows you to configure an endpoint in a particular environment (for example, internal or external network) that is accessible by your target applications.</p>
<p>A proxy API endpoint exists in the Cloud and is similar to a virtual service. Users access the proxy that runs in the Cloud, rather than accessing the API endpoint directly. Traffic is channeled via the proxy to your target API. This is more secure for your API. You can also use a vanity hostname, to make things easier for your users.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Internal / External Networks</strong>&#8212;If you want to access your real API on an internal network, but want to expose specific functionality on an external network, you can add the API Target URL using the <strong>Add a New API</strong> function, and then virtualize the API by specifying a Proxy API Target URL for specific functionality you want to make available on an external network.</p>
<p><strong>Bridge Between App and Proxy API</strong>&#8212;If your API is focused on the business aspects of the API or service, you can set up the proxy API to provide other tasks such as security enforcement or specifications required by the target (for example, API specs for the app team).</p>
<p><strong>Sandbox / Live Implementation Access</strong>&#8212;App developers can access either your Live implementation, Sandbox implementation, or both.</p>
<p><strong>Contract Enforcement</strong>&#8212;If you configure your API with a proxy, you can take advantage of the platform's contract enforcement functionality. Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
	<li>When you add an API to the platform your policy administrator adds a series of security policies to the Tenant Organization for your platform using the Akana Policy Manager Console. Site or Policy Administrators can refer to the Akana API Platform Installation Guide for more information. <a href="basics_support.htm#support_contact">Email Technical Support</a> for more information.</li>
	<li>In the platform, apps that would like to have access to your API submit and <strong>API Access Request</strong>.</li>
	<li>When the request is approved, the app is &quot;connected&quot; to the API.</li>
	<li>The security policies are in force when the app is connected to the API and ensure that only authorized applications can gain access to your API at runtime.</li>
	</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if your API is not configured with a proxy, you will need to provide your own firewall rules and security approach to restrict applications making calls to your API.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="platform_support_of_overloaded_operations">Does the platform support overloaded operations?</h2>
<p>The platform supports adding <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_overloaded_operation">overloaded operations</a> in API Designer. Overloaded operations are displayed in the generated Swagger documentation for the API via <strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Documentation</strong> in the Akana API Portal.</p>
<p>However, the Swagger 2.0 standard specification does not support overloaded operations, so only one operation will show up in the generated API documentation. Also, if the Swagger documentation includes overloaded operations, the raw Swagger JSON is not available from <strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Implementations</strong> (bottom of page) &gt; links to definition language (on the right). Instead, an error message is returned. The platform supports display of the generated swagger documentation to API users viewing API documentation via <strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Document</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="api_search_results">How can I control the search results entry for my API?</h2>
<h4 class="stamp">Valid in Version: 2019.1.32 and later</h4>
<p>When users search for your API in the <strong>All APIs</strong> list, or perform any search that will include your API in the search results, a snippet of information is displayed about your API in the search results.</p>
<p>The search results entry is an opportunity to showcase your API in a brief summary.</p>
<p>In versions prior to 2019.1.32, the Community Manager developer portal displayed information from the <strong>API Description</strong> field for the search results entry. In version 2019.1.32 and later, it supports keyword search in the <strong>Summary</strong> field also. To match a search term, it pulls the copy for the search results entry from a concatenation of both these fields in the API definition:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Summary</li>
	<li>API Description (or API Name if no API Description is provided)</li>
</ol>
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: For information about setting up the <strong>Summary</strong> and <strong>API Description</strong> fields, see <a href="#proc_api_edit">To edit basic data about an API or API version</a> above.</p>

<h3 id="search_results_entry_construction">How the search results entry is constructed</h3>
<p>For the search results entry, the Search feature pulls from a concatenated string of the Summary and Description fields, using an ellipsis (...) as a delimiter if information is pulled from different sections.</p>
<p>There are two basic scenarios:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>With no search string provided:</strong>
		<p>In the All APIs list, if no search term is specified, the Search feature lists the Summary, if provided, then an ellipsis (...), then the Description (or API Name if Description is not provided). If the concatenation of these two fields is very long, only a segment of the Description is shown.</p></li>
	<li><strong>With search string:</strong>
<p>The Search feature pulls from the concatenated Summary and Description fields to create the search results entry. Where a match is found, a few words are included before or after the search word or string to provide context. If the search results entry includes information from both Summary and Description, an ellipsis is used as a separator. The word or words from the search string are bolded in the search results entry.</p>
<p>The exact format of the search results entry depends on the terms searched for, where they fall in the Summary and/or Description, and the amount of copy in the Summary and Description fields.	</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on where the search term or terms appear in the concatenated string of Summary + Description, as well as the amount of copy, the search results entry might include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Only words from the Summary.</li>
	<li>Only words from the Description.</li>
	<li>Segments (or the entire copy, if short) from both Summary and Description.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="search_results_entry_examples">Search entry results: examples</h3>
<p>The examples below illustrate the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#app_search_results_example_01">Example #1: No search term</a></li>
	<li><a href="#app_search_results_example_02">Example #2: Only the Summary includes a match for the search term</a></li>

	<li><a href="#app_search_results_example_04">Example #4: Both Summary and Description include a match for the search term</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="app_search_results_example_01">Example #1: No search term</h4>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search term: None</li>
	<li><strong>Summary</strong> text: ACME Payments API Summary: Encompasses all ACME Payments APIs</li>
	<li><strong>API Description</strong> text: ACME Payments API Description: Includes functions from all ACME Payments APIs including Billing, Collections, and Credit Processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, no search term was specified. Because the copy is not very long, the search results include the full Summary text, an ellipsis, and the full Description text.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the total text string is very long, only a segment of it is included in the search results.</p>
<p><img src="assets/api_search_results_01.png" alt="Search results entry for an API, example #1" /></p>

<h4 id="app_search_results_example_02">Example #2: Only the Summary includes a match for the search term </h4>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search term: collections</li>
	<li><strong>Summary</strong> text: Summary: ACME Payments Corp collections API</li>
	<li><strong>API Description</strong> text: API Description: Includes all functions for activities related to collecting funds.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the search term appears in the summary. In the search results, it is highlighted. The search entry also includes the ellipsis and a fragment of the API Description. At least a few words are include before and after the search term in the search results, to provide context.</p>
<p><img src="assets/api_search_results_02.png" alt="Search results entry for an API, example #2" /></p>

<h4 id="app_search_results_example_03">Example #3: Only the Description includes a match for the search term</h4>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search term: subscription</li>
	<li><strong>Summary</strong> text: Top-level API for all ACME Payments customers</li>
	<li><strong>API Description</strong> text: Includes many features including access to operations in all secondary ACME Payments APIs; collections, invoicing, billing, and many other functions. Cloud-based; subscription-based; a mature product with a tight iterative lifecycle.</li></ul>
<p>In this example, because of the length of the string of Summary + Description, partial copy is included in the search results. Only the segment of the API Description that includes the search keyword is included. At least a few words are included before and after the search term in the search results, to provide context.</p>
<p><img src="assets/api_search_results_03.png" alt="Search results entry for an API, example #3" /></p>

<h4 id="app_search_results_example_04">Example #4: Both Summary and Description include a match for the search term </h4>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search term: professional</li>
	<li><strong>Summary</strong> text: ACME Payments professional collections API</li>
	<li><strong>API Description</strong> text: A full-featured collections API for finance professionals in Fortune 500 companies who want to use Cloud-based software for their collections activities, linking to banks and other financial institutions as well as customer databases.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the search results entry, segments of the two fields, each containing the search term, are separated by an ellipsis (...) as shown below. Because the string of Summary + Description is longer, only applicable sections of the copy are included in the search results entry. As with earlier examples, at least a few words are include before and after the search term in the search results, to provide context. The search term is highlighted.</p>

<p>You can export information about an API to an external file. You can then import that file to another instance of the platform. One use of this feature is to move data from one environment to another, such as from a development environment to a testing or Live implementation.</p>
<p>You can also choose whether or not to export additional data associated with the API, such as policies, contracts, scopes, and documentation.</p>
<h4>To export an API:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Log in to the Akana API Platform and go to the overview page for your API.</li>
	<li>From the left menu bar, choose <strong>Details</strong>. The summary of the API design is displayed on the <strong>Details</strong> page.</li>
	<li>In the top section, click the drop-down, and choose <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Export</strong> dialog, choose the versions you want to export (Current or All) and the options. If you want to export all information about the API, check all boxes. You can export the following data associated with the API:
		<ul>
			<li>Export Operational Policies</li>
			<li>Export QoS Policies</li>
			<li>Export API Administrators
				<p><strong>Note</strong>: the relationship of the user as an API admin is exported, but the user is not exported. The user must exist in the target environment. If the user does not exist when the information is imported, the API is created without that admin. From there, either a) the user can sign up and be invited to be an admin, b) the user can sign up and the API data can be reimported, c) another individual can be designated as an API admin.</p></li>
			<li>Export API Implementation Services
				<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the API was created using an existing service, this option allows you to choose whether or not to export the API implementation services, as set up in Policy Manager. If the API was created as a new service, implementation services are always exported along with API.</p></li>
			<li>Export API Contracts</li>
			<li>Export Scopes</li>
			<li>Export Resources/Documentation</li>
			<li>Export API PKI</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>Click <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose to save or open the export file.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="api_export_file_contents">What are the contents of the API export file?</h2>
<p>The API export file includes all the core information about the API, as well as any of the optional additional information you specified.</p>
<p>The file has a very specific structure. It will look something like the image below:</p>
<p><img src="assets/export_file_api.jpg" alt="File structure for an API export file" /></p>
<p>The export file will generally include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Files at root level: 
		<ul>
			<li><strong>objectgraph.xml</strong>: An XML file that shows the relationships between resources.</li>
			<li><strong>objectdata.xml</strong>: An XML-based summary of all the data in the export file.</li>
			<li><strong>exportproperties.properties</strong>: a properties file showing which options were included in the export file.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>bpels</strong>: a folder containing XML business process files (<a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_bpel_file">bpel files</a>). One for each operation, for each environment. So, for example, if the API has five operations, and runs in Sandbox and Live implementations, there are 10 bpel files.</li>
	<li><strong>services</strong>: a folder containing a subfolder for each environment, each subfolder containing a bpel.xml file for the applicable service/environment.</li>
	<li><strong>wsdls</strong>: a folder containing WSDL files for the service.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how_do_i_import_an_api_from_an_export_file">How do I import an API from an export file?</h2>
<p>Once you've exported an API to an external ZIP file, it can be imported to another environment. For example, you can export from a development environment and then import to a testing or Live implementation.</p>
<p>The API Admin or Business Admin can export information about an API to an external file. However, only a Business Admin can import.</p>
<p>If you need help with import functions, contact your Administrator.</p>
<p>If you are an Administrator, see <a href="bus_admin_export_import.htm">Export/Import</a> (Business Admin help).</p>
