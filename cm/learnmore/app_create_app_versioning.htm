<a name="how_does_app_versioning_work"></a><h3>How does app versioning work?</h3>
<p>During the app development process, the need may arise where  you require different app versions. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You may want to have one app  that is strictly a support/testing version, and another that is a production  version, or you may want to have variations of your app that utilize different  APIs.</li>
  <li>You may want to transfer an app defined on another system to the platform. In this scenario you would use the <strong>+Version</strong> function on the <em>App Details</em> page to add the app as a version of an app that is already added to the platform and assign a custom App ID and/or Shared Secret.</li>
<li>You may also want to separate usage monitoring, discussions, and ticket  management by app version.</li>
</ul>

<p>To facilitate this, the <em>My Apps</em> section includes app  versioning functionality that allows you to create a new instance (i.e., version) of an existing app.</p>
<p><strong>App Version Composition</strong></p>
<p>When you create your first app (i.e., Version 1.0):</p>
<ul>
  <li>You define an App  Name and a system generated Version ID is assigned.</li>
<li>A <em>Current Version</em> menu item is displayed on the <em>My Apps</em> title bar.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Create New App Version</em></p>
<p>After creating your Version 1.0 app, you can then create an  app version using the<strong> + Version </strong> function accessible via the <em>App Details</em> page.</p>

<ul>
<li>An App Version name is composed of the Version ID (i.e., App Name).</li>
<li>The Version ID is accessible via the <em>Current Version</em> menu. You can also  assign Version Notes and Tags to further identify the app version definition.</li>
<li>You can assign a custom App Runtime ID and/or Shared Secret.</li>
<li>The Version ID   can  be modified using the <strong>Edit </strong> function on the <em>App Details</em> page.</li>
<li>After creating  your app version, you can then assign credentials, submit an API Access Request, and  perform app management activities.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: When the app version is created, the platform also auto-generates an internal App ID. This App ID is what you  use in API calls. Refer to the API documentation in the API &gt; Documents section for more information. .</em></p>
<p><strong>  Viewing App Versions</strong></p>
<p>  You can navigate to an app version by selecting it on the  <em>Current Version</em> menu.</p>
<p><strong>  Team Management</strong></p>
<p>  In <em>My Apps</em>, Team Member assignments apply to ALL apps versions. A unique set of Team Members cannot be assigned to a specific app version.</p>
<p><strong>  App Management</strong></p>
<p>  App versions can be managed using a variety of different  tools available in the <em>App Details</em> page.</p>

<h5>To create a new app version:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>My Apps &gt; App Details</em> for the app you would like to create a version for.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>+ Version</strong>. The <em>Edit App Info</em> page displays. The following information displays:<br />
    <br />
    <table cellspacing="0px" class="doctable" style="width: 98%;">

        <td>A text box that allows you to enter a custom app identity for the current app definition. If left blank, the app will be randomly assigned an App ID (i.e., identity) in the format &lt;fedmember&gt; - &lt;random-hex&gt;. Note that an App ID cannot be changed after an App ID is assigned. You must create a new app version using the <strong>+Version</strong> function on the <em>App Details</em> page and issue a custom app identity.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="t2row">
        <td>Shared Secret</td>
        <td>A text box that allows you to enter a custom Shared Secret for the current app definition. If left blank, a shared secret is automatically generated and can be viewed using the <strong>Show Keys &gt; Click to View </strong> function on the <em>App Details</em> page.

<a name="how_do_i_delete_an_app_version"></a><h3>How do I delete an app version?</h3>
<p>You can delete an app version on the <em>App Details</em> page.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to delete an old version and add a new version, add the new version first. If you delete the only version, the app is deleted. If you add the new version, you can then delete the older version.</p>
<h5><a name="pro_to_delete_an_app_version"></a>To delete an app version</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>My Apps</em>.</li>
  <li>From the <em>Version</em> menu at the top right of the page, choose the version you want to delete.</li>
  <li>Click <strong> Delete Version</strong>.</li>
  <li>At the confirmation message, click <strong>OK</strong>. The app version is deleted.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_delete_an_app"></a><h3>How do I delete an app?</h3>
<p>When there is only one version of an app, and you delete it, the entire app is deleted. If there is more than one version, and you want to delete the app, you must delete each version separately.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In some cases, the platform might be set up so that deleting an app requires Business Admin approval. If this is the case, and you attempt to delete the app, you will see a message that the deletion request has been sent for approval. The app is inactivated pending approval. When the Business Admin approves the request, the app is fully deleted. If for any reason the Business Admin denies the request, the app is restored to normal operation.</p>
<h5>To delete an app</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Follow the instructions in <a href="#pro_to_delete_an_app_version">To delete an app version</a> above.</li>
  <li>The confirmation message warns you that deleting the last version deletes the app. Click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm. The app is deleted.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_export_an_app"></a><h3>How do I export an app?</h3>
<p>You can export information about an app to an external file. You can then import that file to another instance of the platform. One use of this feature is to move data from one environment to another, such as from a development environment to a testing or production environment.</p>
<p>You can choose to export information about a single app version or all app versions. You can also choose whether or not to export additional data associated with the app.</p>
<h5>To export an app:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the Details page for the app (<em>My Apps</em> &gt; choose the app).</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the Export overlay, choose export versions (current version or all versions) and choose export options. If you want to export all information about the app, check all boxes. You can choose to export the following additional data associated with the app:
    <ul>
  <li>Export App PKI</li>
  <li>Export API Contracts</li>
  <li>Export App Team Members<br />
    <strong>Note</strong>: the relationship of the user as an app team member is exported, but the user is not exported. The user must exist in the target environment. If the user does not exist when the information is imported, the app is created without that team member. From there, either a) the user can sign up and be invited to be an app team member, b) the user can sign up and the app data can be reimported, c) another individual can be designated as an app team member.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
  <li>Choose to save or open the export file. By default, the export package file is named <strong>application-export.zip</strong> and is saved to your default downloads folder.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_are_the_contents_of_the_app_export_file"></a>
<h3>What are the contents of the app export file?</h3>
<p>The app export file includes all the core information about the app, as well as any of the optional additional information you specified.</p>
<p>The file has a very specific structure. It will generally include the following files at root level:  </p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>objectgraph.xml</strong>: An XML file that shows the relationships between resources.</li>
   <li><strong>objectdata.xml</strong>: An XML-based  summary of all the data in the export file.</li>
   <li><strong>exportproperties.properties</strong>: a properties file showing which options were included in the export file.</li>
</ul>
<p>If PKI information was chosen to be exported, it is stored in a separate pki subfolder.</p>

<a name="how_do_i_import_an_app_from_an_export_file"></a>
<h3>How do I import an app from an export file?</h3>
<p>Any member of the app team, or a Business Admin, can export  information about an app to an external file. However, only a Business Admin can import.</p>
<p>If you need help with import functions, contact your Business Admin.</p>
<p>If you are a Business Admin, refer to <a href="business_admin_export_import.htm#how_do_i_import_site_app_or_api_information_from_an_export_file">How do I import site, app, or API information from an export file?</a> for instructions.</p>
