<h2 id="how_do_i_search_for_information">How do I search for information in the Community Manager developer portal?</h2>
<p>The Community Manager developer portal includes multiple ways of finding the information you need, including information about APIs, Forum discussions, and Alerts.</p>
<p>You can search in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the Search feature in the top menu bar to search for any type of information. See <a href="#search_how_use">How do I use the Search feature?</a></li>
	<li>Search through information in a specific forum, such as API, Discussion, or Ticket. See <a href="#search_forums">How can I search in forums?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="search_results_info_types">What types of information are included in search results?</h2>
<p>You can choose a functional area for your search, as shown below. The platform searches through information associated with APIs, apps, groups, and users.</p>
<table class="doctable">
	<thead>
	<tr>

<h2 id="search_how_use">How do I use the Search feature?</h2>
<p>Select the <strong>Search</strong> menu by clicking the magnifying glass icon that displays to the right of the top navigation. Specify search criteria in the <strong>Search</strong> text box (at least three characters).</p>

<h4>To search from the top menu bar</h4>
<ol>
	<li>From the top menu bar, use the Search box to search for any content on the platform, as shown below.
<p>Hermosa Theme, 2019.1.0 and later: click the magnifying glass in the top menu bar to open the Search bar.</p>
<p><img src="assets/search_main_hermosa_201910.png" alt="Using Search (Hermosa Theme)" /></p>
<p>Hermosa Theme, versions up to 2019.1.0: The Search bar is in the top menu bar.</p>
<p><img src="assets/search_main_hermosa.jpg" alt="Using Search (Hermosa Theme)" /></p></li>
	<li>Type your search criteria into the text box (3&#8211;20 characters), and then click to search. The search results are displayed.</li>
	<li>When you have your search results, you can also use the additional options to refine your search, as shown below.
<p>Hermosa Theme, below top menu bar:</p>
<p><img src="assets/search_secondary_hermosa.jpg" alt="Search feature secondary menu bar (Hermosa Theme)" /></p>
<p>You can filter using these options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Type</strong>: All, APIs, Apps, Groups, Organizations, Discussions, Tickets, Alerts, Reviews, or Documents</li>
		<li><strong>Sort By</strong>: Highest Rated, Most Used, Most Popular, Last Updated, Most Relevant, or Alphabetical</li>
		<li><strong>Search</strong>: If needed, modify the search term in the Search box. Otherwise, it defaults to the initial search term you entered.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="search_special_characters">How do I use special characters in search?</h2>
<p>If you're searching for something that has special characters in it, you might not get the expected results. A search for text containing special characters has to be written in a special way.</p>
<p>The search feature has certain characters that are reserved. The reserved characters are:</p>
<p><strong>+ - = &amp;&amp; || &gt; &lt; ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ &quot; ~ * ? : \ /</strong></p>
<p>If any reserved characters are included in search terms, they'll need to be escaped, or the search feature will not work as expected. Escaping the character means that you include a backslash (\) immediately before it.</p>
<p>For example, to search for <strong>(123)app</strong>, you'd have to search for the following: <strong>\(123\)app</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're naming platform resources such as apps and APIs, it's best to steer clear of special characters. If you're searching for resources that include these characters, escape them as above and you'll get the expected results.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="search_forums">How can I search in forums?</h2>
<p>You can search in the following forums:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#forum_search_my_forum">My Forum</a>: available to all logged-in users. Includes forum entries for all APIs, apps, and groups that the specific user is associated with.</li>
	<li><a href="#forum_search_app_forum">App Forum</a>: for public apps, or apps the logged-in user is associated with.</li>
	<li><a href="#forum_search_api_forum">API Forum</a>: for public APIs, or APIs the logged-in user is associated with.</li>
	<li><a href="#forum_search_group_forum">Group Forum</a> for public groups, or groups the logged-in user is associated with.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="forum_search_my_forum">My Forum</h3>
<p>The example below shows how search works on the Forum page for an individual. In this example, the user types in a few characters of a search term and the Community Manager developer portal offers matching results. The user can then choose from the drop-down results list.</p>
<p>The platform searches through information associated with APIs, apps, groups, and users.</p>
<p>The user can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search by Published or Unpublished items.</li>
	<li>Search by Alerts, Contract Requests, Discussions, Group Membership Requests, Reviews, Tickets, or All Forum Items:
	<p><img src="assets/forum_user_all.jpg" alt="User forum search: forum items" /></p></li>
	<li>Enter search wording; the UI presents matching results in a list that the user can then choose from.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="assets/forum_user.jpg" alt="User forum search" /></p>


<h3 id="forum_search_app_forum">App Forum</h3>
<p>The example below shows how search works on the Forum page for an app. In this example, the user is searching by tags. The user types in the first few letters of the word &quot;offer&quot; and there is one matching result, since there is one discussion that has &quot;offer&quot; set up as a tag. In this example, you can see the matching entry, even though the user didn't yet choose the result, because it happens to be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>In the App Forum, the user can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search by Type: <strong>Discussions</strong>, <strong>Tickets</strong>, <strong>Alerts</strong>, <strong>Requests</strong>, or <strong>All</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the API drop-down list, choose an API the app is associated with, or All.</li>
	<li>Sort search results by Most Recent, Most Popular, or Most Marked.</li>
	<li>Specify version: This version, or All versions.</li>
	<li>Search by tags.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="assets/forum_app.jpg" alt="App forum search" /></p>


<h3 id="forum_search_api_forum">API Forum</h3>
<p>The example below shows how search works on the Forum page for an API. In this example, the user is searching in Discussions, for a discussion with a tag of &quot;version.&quot; The user types in the first few letters of the word &quot;version&quot; and there is one matching result, since there is one discussion that has &quot;version&quot; set up as a tag. In this example, you can see the matching entry, even though the user didn't yet choose the result, because it happens to be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>In the API Forum, the user can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search by Type: <strong>Discussions</strong>, <strong>Tickets</strong>, <strong>Alerts</strong>, <strong>Requests</strong>, or <strong>All</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the Apps drop-down list, choose an app that the API is associated with, or All.</li>
	<li>Sort search results by Most Recent, Most Popular, or Most Marked.</li>
	<li>Specify version: This version, or All versions.</li>
	<li>Search by tags.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="assets/forum_api.jpg" alt="API forum search" /></p>

<h3 id="forum_search_group_forum">Group Forum</h3>
<p>The example below shows how search works on the Forum page for a group. </p>
<p>The user can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search by Type: <strong>Discussions</strong>, <strong>Tickets</strong>, <strong>Alerts</strong>, <strong>Requests</strong>, or <strong>All</strong>.</li>
	<li>Sort search results by Most Recent, Most Popular, or Most Marked.</li>
	<li>Search by tags.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="assets/forum_group.jpg" alt="Group forum search" /></p>
