      <th>Default Theme, left menu bar:</th>
      <th>Hermosa Theme, below top menu bar:</th>

  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="search_special_characters">How do I use special characters in search?</h3>
<p>If you're searching for something that has special characters in it, you might not get the expected results. A search for text containing special characters has to be written in a special way.</p>
<p>The search feature has certain characters that are reserved. The reserved characters are:</p>
<p><strong>+ - = &amp;&amp; || &gt; &lt; ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ &quot; ~ * ? : \ /</strong></p>
<p>If any reserved characters are included in search terms, they'll need to be escaped, or the search feature will not work as expected. Escaping the character means that you include a backslash (\) immediately before it.</p>
<p>For example, to search for <strong>(123)app</strong>, you'd have to search for the following: <strong>\(123\)app</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're naming platform resources such as apps and APIs, it's best to steer clear of special characters. If you're searching for resources that include these characters, escape them as above and you'll get the expected results.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h3 id="search_forums">How can I search in forums?</h3>
<p>You can search in the following forums:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#forum_search_my_forum">My Forum</a>: available to all logged-in users. Includes forum entries for all APIs, apps, and groups that the specific user is associated with.</li>
	<li><a href="#forum_search_app_forum">App Forum</a>: for public apps, or apps the logged-in user is associated with.</li>
	<li><a href="#forum_search_api_forum">API Forum</a>: for public APIs, or APIs the logged-in user is associated with.</li>
	<li><a href="#forum_search_group_forum">Group Forum</a> for public groups, or groups the logged-in user is associated with.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="forum_search_my_forum">My Forum</h4>
<p>The example below shows how search works on the Forum page for an individual. In this example, the user types in a few characters of a search term and the developer portal offers matching results. The user can then choose from the drop-down results list.</p>
<p>The platform searches through information associated with APIs, apps, groups, and users.</p>
<p>The user can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search by Published or Unpublished items.</li>
	<li>Search by Alerts, Contract Requests, Discussions, Group Membership Requests, Reviews, Tickets, or All Forum Items:
  <p><img src="assets/forum_user_all.jpg" alt="User forum search: forum items" /></p></li>
	<li>Enter search wording; the UI presents matching results in a list that the user can then choose from.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="assets/forum_user.jpg" alt="User forum search" /></p>


<h4 id="forum_search_app_forum">App Forum</h4>
<p>The example below shows how search works on the Forum page for an app. In this example, the user is searching by tags. The user types in the first few letters of the word &quot;offer&quot; and there is one matching result, since there is one discussion that has &quot;offer&quot; set up as a tag. In this example, you can see the matching entry, even though the user didn't yet choose the result, because it happens to be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>In the App Forum, the user can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search by Type: <strong>Discussions</strong>, <strong>Tickets</strong>, <strong>Alerts</strong>, <strong>Requests</strong>, or <strong>All</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the API drop-down list, choose an API the app is associated with, or All.</li>
	<li>Sort search results by Most Recent, Most Popular, or Most Marked.</li>
	<li>Specify version: This version, or All versions.</li>
	<li>Search by tags.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="assets/forum_app.jpg" alt="App forum search" /></p>


<h4 id="forum_search_api_forum">API Forum</h4>
<p>The example below shows how search works on the Forum page for an API. In this example, the user is searching in Discussions, for a discussion with a tag of &quot;version.&quot; The user types in the first few letters of the word &quot;version&quot; and there is one matching result, since there is one discussion that has &quot;version&quot; set up as a tag. In this example, you can see the matching entry, even though the user didn't yet choose the result, because it happens to be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>In the API Forum, the user can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search by Type: <strong>Discussions</strong>, <strong>Tickets</strong>, <strong>Alerts</strong>, <strong>Requests</strong>, or <strong>All</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the Apps drop-down list, choose an app that the API is associated with, or All.</li>
	<li>Sort search results by Most Recent, Most Popular, or Most Marked.</li>
	<li>Specify version: This version, or All versions.</li>
	<li>Search by tags.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="assets/forum_api.jpg" alt="API forum search" /></p>

<h4 id="forum_search_group_forum">Group Forum</h4>
<p>The example below shows how search works on the Forum page for a group. </p>
<p>The user can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search by Type: <strong>Discussions</strong>, <strong>Tickets</strong>, <strong>Alerts</strong>, <strong>Requests</strong>, or <strong>All</strong>.</li>
	<li>Sort search results by Most Recent, Most Popular, or Most Marked.</li>
	<li>Search by tags.</li>
</ul>
