<h2 id="platform_app_testing">What app testing tools does the platform provide?</h2>
<p>The platform provides a Test Client tool that you can use to try out different APIs. The Test Client is a web-based REST client, and is accessible in the context of either an App or an API.</p>
<p><strong>To test your app with Test Client</strong>: Choose the app, go to the app's <strong>Details</strong> page, and then, on the left menu, choose Test Client. From the drop-down list, choose an API that your app is connected to. If the API supports anonymous testing, you can also test it without specifying an app at all.</p>
<p><strong>To test an API with one or more of your apps</strong>: Choose the API, go to the API Details page, and then, on the left menu, choose Test Client. From the drop-down list, choose one of your apps.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="#what_is_the_test_client">What is the Test Client?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="tc_test_app_sandbox">How do I test my app in the sandbox?</h2>
<p>When you submit an API access request for an API's sandbox environment, and your request is approved, you can test your app using the sandbox endpoint.</p>
<p>In many cases, though not all, access to the Sandbox endpoint is granted automatically, so you don't have to wait for approval. If you're not sure whether the contract is approved yet, go to the app's <strong>Details</strong> page and, on the left, click APIs. You'll see the status of your contract; most likely, either <strong>Pending</strong> or <strong>Approved</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you have access to the sandbox endpoint, you can test your app with the API. For example, you might want to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Test the behavior of your app with API calls to verify that the behavior is as expected.</li>
	<li>Test with simulated transactions and data.</li>
	<li>Check that the flow of information to the app is predictable (the expected information in the expected format).</li>
	<li>Check that the app is processing the API results correctly.</li>
	<li>Test error handling and usability.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using a testing environment, you can experiment with different scenarios and make adjustments as needed to make sure that your app works as expected with the API.</p>
<p>You can use the platform's built-in Test Client testing tool. See <a href="#what_is_the_test_client">What is the Test Client?</a> below.</p>
<p>If the API supports monitoring, you can view your transaction traffic via monitoring charts and logs. For more information on performance monitoring, see <a href="app_monitoring.htm#analytics_app_overview">How can I see an overview of my app's performance?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>




<h2 id="platform_api_test_rest_clients">What are some sample REST clients I can use to test an API I want to use?</h2>
<p>Examples of test clients you can use to send REST requests include: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/" target="_blank">RESTClient Firefox Add-on</a>, <a href="https://www.soapui.org/" target="_blank">soapUI</a>, and <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use the platform's built-in Test Client testing tool. See <a href="#what_is_the_test_client">What is the Test Client?</a> below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>




<h2 id="what_is_the_test_client">What is the Test Client?</h2>
<p>The Test Client tool built into the platform is a web-based REST client that allows you to test different APIs in the context of an app. You can use it to try out any API that your app has a contract with, or to try out an API in the context of an app you have visibility of, or even without an app context if the API supports anonymous access.</p>
<p>Test Client is available:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For testing an app: Apps &gt; specific app &gt; Test Client.</li>
	<li>For testing an API: APIs &gt; specific API &gt; Test Client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Test Client supports simple testing of an app against an API. However, it also supports more complex variations that there might be in the rules governing use of a specific API. It supports many more options than its predecessor in earlier versions of the platform, Test Client. This allows you to much more realistically emulate, and therefore test, the actual conditions of the app/API interaction at runtime. </p>
<p>If a specific API doesn't support specific functionality, you won't see those options available for selection in Test Client. For example, if the API supports OAuth, but only supports OAuth 2.0 and only two grant types, you'll only see those specific choices available.</p>
<p>Assuming that a specific API  supports these features, Test Client supports the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>App authentication with shared secret or by uploading a security certificate</li>
	<li>OAuth 1.0a</li>
	<li>OAuth 2.0 with all four standard grant types:
		<ul>
			<li>Authorization Code</li>
			<li>Implicit</li>
			<li>Resource Owner Password Credentials</li>
			<li>Client Credentials</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	<li>Different authentication methods:
		<ul>
			<li>Global Setting: this option includes Shared Secret, Shared Secret + PKI, and all additional authentication methods that the API supports</li>
			<li>SHA1 with RSA</li>
			<li>SHA 256 with RSA</li>
			<li>HMAC SHA1</li>
			<li>HMAC SHA 256</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Different OAuth token locations:
		<ul>
			<li>Header</li>
			<li>Query String</li>
			<li>Form</li>
			<li>Cookie</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Again&#8212;when you're using Test Client, you probably won't see all the above options. You only see the options available to you, and that depends on the API you're testing with. </p>
<p>For specific information about the above options, how they're set up, and how to determine the values, you should choose, refer to the referenced sections.</p>
<p>Most or all APIs on the platform have the <a href="api_admin_policy_list.htm#pl_AtmosphereApplicationSecurityPolicy">API Consumer Application Security Policy</a> assigned. This policy is used to identify (authenticate) the app. Depending on how the policy is set up by the Administrator, you  can authenticate with an ID and Shared Secret value, or you can upload a certificate. If the API supports it, you can also test the API in an anonymous context.</p>
<p>Specific APIs might have other security <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy">policies</a> assigned. The policies assigned to the API you're using will affect the settings and options you'll see in Test Client. For specifics, refer to the API documentation.</p>
<p>When your application is connected to an API (through the <strong>Access</strong> request process), the application security credentials you've assigned to your app (via <strong>App Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Security Credentials</strong>) work in conjunction with the API security policies. The request message that is sent to the API must conform to the security policies assigned to the API or the request will fail.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If your app's contract with an API includes one or more licenses, Test Client displays only the operations that the app has permission to access based on the license governing the contract.</p>
<p>You can use Test Client to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Determine what is needed to send a request to an API.</li>
	<li>Verify that you can successfully send a request to an API.</li>
	<li>Test different API operations.</li>
	<li>Experiment with URL encoding turned on or off.</li>
	<li>Troubleshoot&#8212;If your API calls are failing, you can use Test Client to help identify what's wrong.
		<p>For example, if your app sends a request message to the API and it is rejected, it might be because the security credentials in your app don't match the valid options configured in the API policy. Let's say  your app is configured with an SHA1 - Shared Secret, but the API Policy is configured to accept only SHA with RSA - PKI. In this case, the credential mismatch would cause the request to fail. You can use Test Client to see what options the API supports and to test with different credentials.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Before using Test Client:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choose an API you would like to test with your app (or, if the API supports it, to test in an anonymous context). </li>
	<li>Add an app to the platform: see <a href="app_create_app_add.htm#add_app">How do I add an app?</a> If needed, assign security credentials in the <strong>App Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Security Credentials</strong> section.</li>
	<li>Submit an access request for the API you want to try out. On the API Details page, click the <strong>Access</strong> link. The API Access Request must be approved before you can begin testing the API with the Test Client. In many cases, a contract with the Sandbox implementation might be automatically approved; generally, access to the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/environ_live.lbi" -->Live<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> implementation requires manual approval by an API Admin, and might take a little longer. Whether approval is automatic or manual, and how long manual approval takes, depends on the API.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Test Client includes an API drop-down that displays a list of the APIs that your app is currently connected to. When you select an API from the drop-down, the platform analyzes the API configuration and the security policies assigned to the API and populates the fields with the appropriate information. After the Test Client is populated, you configure each test case and then click <strong>Invoke</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="tc_test_api">How do I test an API in Test Client?</h2>
<p>The Test Client testing tool allows you to test any API you have access to, with the following options:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>In the context of the API</strong>: If you don't have an app, or you just want to try out the API on its own, you can test the API with anonymous access (if the API supports it; this depends on the API. If the option for anonymous access doesn't appear it's because the specific API you've chosen doesn't support anonymous access). Choose the API and then, on the left menu bar, choose Test Client. Click <strong>Setup</strong> and specify the app you want to use, or choose the <strong>Anonymous</strong> option if it's available.</li>
	<li><strong>In the context of an app</strong>: If your app has an active contract with the API, you can test the API with your app. Choose the app and then, on the left menu bar, choose Test Client. In the drop-down list, specify the API. Click <strong>Setup</strong> and specify the app you want to use, or choose the <strong>Anonymous</strong> option if it's available.</li>
	<li>If you have multiple apps, you can choose any one of your apps to test against the API. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: To use all the features of Test Client, you'll need to enable popups on your browser.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="tc_test_app">How do I test my app in Test Client?</h2>
<p>To test your app in Test Client, follow the steps below.</p>
<h4>To test an app in Test Client</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Set up an app in the developer platform. For instructions, see <a href="app_create_app_add.htm#add_app">How
    do I create a new app?</a></li>
	<li>Set up a contract between your app and the API you want to test. For instructions, see <a href="app_access_apis_api_access.htm#app_api_access">How do I get API access for my app?</a></li>
	<li>Go to Test Client and choose the API/environment you want to test.</li>
	<li>Choose the operation you want to try out.</li>
	<li>Specify additional values needed for the specific operation, such as headers and parameters. Test Client offers you the choices that are valid for the specific API and operation that you've chosen.</li>
	<li>Check the URL to make sure it looks right.</li>
	<li>Set up additional security values as needed. The requirements will vary depending on the security mechanisms supported by the API and used by your app. If the API uses OAuth you'll need to authenticate and get a token.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Invoke</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="tc_viewing_response">What are the different ways I can view the response information in Test Client?</h2>
<p>When you click <strong>Invoke</strong>, the request and response are displayed. You can use this information to test and debug as needed. You can also click the tabs to see different formats or additional information:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Raw</strong>: Raw JSON, XML, or other content.</li>
	<li><strong>Formatted</strong>: Formatted JSON, XML, or other content.</li>
	<li><strong>Pretty</strong>: Formatted content, with the option to expand or collapse nodes in JSON or XML&#8212;useful for larger response objects.</li>
	<li><strong>Headers</strong>: the response headers for the API call.</li>
	<li><strong>Trace</strong>: This tab shows additional operations Test Client is running in the background to get the token and deliver the response. This is for debugging purposes only. The Trace tab also shows the progression of steps as the API call is processed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example below shows a successful response displayed in the Raw tab.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="tc_test_app_with_oauth">How do I test my app with OAuth?</h2>
<p>If your app will be using OAuth, it's a good idea to test in Test Client to make sure everything is working properly.</p>
<p>First, you'll need to make sure that the API supports OAuth 2.0, and supports this specific grant type. Check the API documentation.</p>
<p>OAuth values are set up in the second page of the <strong>Security</strong> wizard. In Test Client, first set up the app/API information and the app credentials, and then you're ready to try out OAuth.</p>
<h4>Pre-conditions</h4>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Connection</strong>: Your app must be connected to the API. See <a href="app_access_apis_api_access.htm#app_api_access">How do I get API access for my app?</a></li>
	<li><strong>OAuth support</strong>: The API must support OAuth. If you're not sure, in Test Client choose the API and operation and then click the <strong>Security</strong> button. Click through the policies pages; if it supports OAuth you'll see the OAuth options (see <a href="#tc_configsettings_oauthpolicy">Test Client security settings: OAuth Policy</a>).</li>
	<li><strong>Credentials</strong>: The app security credentials must be a type of credentials that the API supports.</li>
	<li><strong>Conditional for app security with PKI</strong>: OAuth potentially supports shared secret or PKI options. Actual support in the context of an API depends on the API configuration. If the API supports PKI credentials, and you want to use that option, Test Client needs your app's private key. In Test Client, you'll need to click the <strong>Security</strong> button and upload the keystore, which is a file format that supports both private key and certificate. Test Client supports the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_jks">JKS</a> and <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_pkcs12">PKCS12</a> keystore formats. If you are uploading a keystore, make sure it matches this format.</li>
	<li><strong>App OAuth Profile</strong>: If you want your app to use OAuth, you'll need to set up information in the App OAuth Profile (see <a href="app_create_app_oauth_profile.htm">App OAuth Profile</a>). You can set up the redirect_uri for your app on this page; this is the URI that the OAuth Provider redirects the user to, after authentication. However, unless the OAuth Provider is Akana or PingFederate, you'll also need to register your redirect_uri with the OAuth Provider so that the URL is trusted. The OAuth Provider will only redirect a user to a trusted URL.</li>
</ol>

<p>The procedure below takes you to the OAuth options. Then, follow the applicable linked procedure to test with a specific OAuth version, grant type, or other option.</p>
<h4 id="proc_to_test_in_tc_with_oauth">To test in Test Client with OAuth</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Create a contract with the API. You might want to choose a sandbox environment for testing purposes.</li>
	<li>From the app's <strong>Details</strong> page, on the left, click Test Client.</li>
	<li>Choose the API and operation and supply any applicable details such as headers and any values that the operation requires.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Setup</strong>. The App ID and Shared Secret are displayed. If you want to upload a keystore instead, click <strong>Upload Keystore</strong>, upload the file (must be <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_jks">JKS</a> or <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_pkcs12">PKCS12</a>), and provide the password. Click <strong>Save</strong>. See <a href="#tc_upload_keystore">Upload Keystore</a> below.
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: Test Client requires the private key, included in the P12 or JKS file. Of course, in a production scenario you would not upload the private key. Make sure that you are using a temporary keystore that you will not use in your production implementation.</p>

<h2 id="tc_set_to_no_cache">How can I make sure I always see the latest results in Test Client?</h2>
<p>If the API you're using sets the <strong>cache-control</strong> response header, the response message is cached. When you send multiple requests, the first response is cached for the time specified as the value in the API's cache-control response header, and you may see the same response for all subsequent requests until the cache expires. This could mean that when you send a subsequent request, the response you see is from the cache, not from the server. If this happens, there will only be one transaction log entry, even if you click the <strong>Invoke</strong> button multiple times, until the cache expires or is cleared.</p>
<p>To make sure you are always seeing the latest information, clear your browser cache before sending subsequent requests.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If the API you're testing doesn't have issues with additional query parameters (ignores them rather than returning an error), you can add a query parameter with any name/value. This forces the browser to retrieve a new response rather than using the cached response. This is a better solution than clearing the browser cache in scenarios where there is any caching done in a forward HTTP proxy (or in a CDN), since clearing the browser cache does not clear the cache from these intermediaries.</p>
<p>If you're not sure whether the API caches or not, send two requests and then check the logs for your app (if logs are available for messages to the API you're working with). If both transactions show up, caching is not an issue. If you see only one transaction, it means that the second was served from cache.</p>

<h2 id="tc_test_app_auth_with_oauth">How do I use Test Client to test authorization of my app with an API that supports OAuth?</h2>
<p>The following procedure provides a simple example of how to use the Test Client to test authorizing your app with OAuth and then sending a request.</p>
<h4>To test authorization of an app with an API that supports OAuth, using Test Client</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the app's <strong>Details</strong> page.</li>
	<li>On the left menu, choose <strong>Test Client</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select the API. Based on the API details, the following occurs:
		<ul>
			<li>The details of the API (Endpoint, Operation, Method, Accept header, Content-Type header, Path, and URL) are displayed.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Setup</strong> button is enabled so that you can set up the credentials for your app.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Choose an operation you want to invoke, and specify additional values such as headers and parameters. For more information on these fields, see <a href="#tc_options">What are the options in Test Client?</a></li>
	<li>Set up the additional settings needed to identify your app. Depending on the specific scenario, you might need to set up one or more of the following:
		<ul>
		<li><strong>App credentials</strong>: click <strong>Setup</strong> and enter the App ID and Shared Secret, or upload a keystore file that includes your app's private key and certificate (<a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_jks">JKS</a> or <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_pkcs12">PKCS12</a> keystore). If you upload a keystore file you'll also need to provide the password for the file.
		<p><strong>Note</strong>: Test Client requires the private key, included in the P12 or JKS file. Of course, in a production scenario you would not upload the private key. Make sure that you are using a temporary keystore that you will not use in your production implementation.</p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>For AtmosphereApplicationSecurityPolicy</strong>: Click <strong>Security</strong> and specify Authentication method, Token Algorithm and Token Location. This sets values for generating the security token to be sent to the API endpoint, and determines how it is sent. For details, see <a href="#tc_configsettings_atmoappsecuritypolicy">Test Client security settings: AtmosphereApplicationSecurityPolicy</a> below.</li>
		<li><strong>For JOSE Policy v2 (Unencoded Payload Support)</strong>: Click <strong>Security</strong> and click through the Security wizard to the <strong>Security Policy: JOSE Security v2 page</strong>. Add one or more private headers, if needed, and then click <strong>Next</strong>. For details, see <a href="#tc_configsettings_josepolicy">Test Client security settings: Jose Security Policy v2</a> below.</li>
		<li><strong>For OAuth Security Policy</strong>: Click <strong>Security</strong> and click through the Security wizard to specify the OAuth Version, Grant Type, and Authentication Method. Then click <strong>Get Token</strong> to generate the token. For details, see <a href="#tc_configsettings_oauthpolicy">Test Client security settings: OAuth Policy</a> below.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>To send a test request to the API, click <strong>Invoke</strong>. The results are shown in the Test Client window, and the transaction is recorded in the transaction log for the app and for the API (viewable via <strong>App</strong> &gt; <strong>Analytics</strong>).</li>

<h4 id="tc_configsettings_oauthpolicy_multiple_oap">Test Client security settings: OAuth Policy: Multiple OAuth Providers</h4>
<h4 class="stamp">Valid in Version: 2019.1.0 and later</h4>
<p>If the API supports multiple OAuth providers, you can choose the provider you want to test against. When you choose a different provider from the drop-down list, Test Client updates the list of scopes to show the scopes the provider supports. The scopes that the current API uses, and that are valid for the current operation being tested, are selected by default. </p>
<p>If the API scope configuration includes operation-specific scopes, Test Client matches the scopes displayed to the current use case scenario. For example, if the API has separate scopes for GET, POST, and PUT operations, as in the example below, and you select a GET operation and then click the <strong>Security</strong> button, the scopes for the POST and PUT operations are not displayed.</p>
<p>In the example below, the selected provider supports five scopes displayed with check boxes. Of those, the current API/current operation supports one, selected by default. The other scopes are available for negative testing scenarios.</p>
<p>Choose the provider, specify the other values such as OAuth version and grant type, and then click <strong>Get Token</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="tc_configsettings_httpsecuritypolicy">Test Client settings: HTTP Security Policy</h4>
<p>If the API has the HTTP Security Policy attached, the Test Client user must upload a certificate, in the Authentication Settings, in order to test the API. For details and instructions, see <a href="#tc_settings_security">Test Client: Setup (Authentication Settings)</a>.</p>


<h4 id="tc_configsettings_aggregatepolicy">Test Client security settings: Aggregate Policy</h4>
<h4 class="stamp">Valid in Version: 2019.1.0 and later</h4>
<p>The <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_aggregatepolicy">Aggregate Policy</a> offers a lot of flexibility. Adding an Aggregate Policy to an API allows the API Admin to set up a scenario where multiple policies are combined into one, with either of the following conditions specified:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>AND</strong>: messages must meet the requirements of <strong>all</strong> the policies defined in the Aggregate Policy</li>
		<li><strong>OR</strong>: messages must meet the requirements of <strong>at least one</strong> of the policies defined in the Aggregate Policy</li>
	</ul>
<p>For example, the API Admin might set up a scenario where an Aggregate Policy includes the AtmosphereApplicationSecurityPolicy and also the OAuth Policy, with AND configured. In this scenario, adding only one policy to the API, the Aggregate Policy, provides the security features of both policies.</p>
<p>Test Client supports the Aggregate Policy for testing purposes if the API is configured with one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>AtmosphereApplicationSecurityPolicy</li>
	<li>HTTP Security Policy with Client Certificate option only (requires Authentication Policy, also supported)</li>
	<li>OAuth Security Policy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Community Manager developer portal itself supports many additional policies on APIs. However, Test Client supports only the policies listed in <a href="api_admin_testing_tc.htm#tc_policies_supported">What policies are supported in Test Client?</a>, and the Aggregate Policy can only include the policies listed above. If an API has policies attached that are not supported in Test Client, results might not be as expected. In this scenario, you'll see a message warning you that the policy is not supported and results might be unexpected.</p>
<p>In the example below, the API has an Aggregate Policy which includes the AtmosphereApplicationSecurityPolicy, with an enforcement requirement of AND. This means that the Aggregate Policy includes at least one other policy, and must enforce both of them (or all of them). In this scenario, the <strong>Apply Policy to Request</strong> check box is checked by default, because the Aggregate Policy is configured with an AND condition.</p>
<p><img src="assets/tc_security_aggregate.png" alt="Test Client security: Aggregate Policy" /></p>
<p>By default, this check box inherits the policy configuration, and Test Client enforces the conditions of the policy, or not, depending on the setting. If you change the setting, it doesn't change the behavior of the API that you're sending a test message to. It only changes the way that Test Client composes the request. For example, if there is an Aggregate Policy on the API, and it includes an OAuth Policy with an enforcement requirement of AND, Test Client sends an OAuth token with the request. If you clear the check box, the API still requires an OAuth token, but Test Client doesn't send it with the request. You can use this for test scenarios, including negative testing.</p>

<h2 id="tc_with_operation_specific_policies_app">Does Test Client support policies assigned at the operation level?</h2>
<h4 class="stamp">Valid in Version: 2020.2.0 and later</h4>
<p>An API can have policies assigned to the entire version of the API in a specific implementation (Sandbox or Live). In Version 2020.2.0 and later, policies can also be assigned to a specific operations. So, for example, an API owner might add an extra security policy to POST, PUT, and DELETE operations, but not to the GET operations.</p>
<p>If the API has policies assigned at the operation level, and you're using Test Client and choose that operation, you'll see the series of operation-specific pages just as you would if the policy was assigned for the entire API. In terms of using Test Client, there is no difference to the user experience. Normally, Test Client determines which policies to present to the user based on the API that the user is testing. With operation-specific policies, it depends on the API and also the operation that the user is testing.</p>
<p>All policies supported by Test Client are supported at the operation level. For the list, see <a href="api_admin_testing_tc.htm#tc_policies_supported">What policies are supported in Test Client?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="tc_with_cors">Can I use Test Client to test APIs that have CORS restrictions?</h2>
<p>Yes. Test Client supports testing with APIs that have CORS restrictions, so you can try out the APIs you're interested in before using them in your app.</p>
<p>Many APIs on the Community Manager developer portal will accept only requests from certain trusted domains. These APIs do not support <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_cors">CORS</a> (cross-origin resource sharing). Cross-origin requests are sometimes used to introduce malicious content.</p>
<p>In the context of the API platform, the platform itself is acting as an intermediary (forward proxy) between the client (the app, sending a message to the API) and the API. Calls from clients to the API are sent to the platform and, from there, redirected to the API live endpoint. However, in most cases, the underlying infrastructure, which processes the requests to the API, is on a different domain from the Community Manager developer portal.</p>
<p>In order to support testing with these APIs, Test Client uses a proxy server approach, routing the request via a proxy server hosted on the Community Manager developer portal to the underlying infrastructure and then to the API itself.</p>
<p>With this approach, testing an API that has CORS restrictions is supported in Test Client.</p>
	<p>In <strong>Test Client</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If the API supports CORS: You can check the <strong>API Supports CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)</strong> check box. The request is routed directly to the underlying infrastructure, without going through the proxy server. Note: if you don't check the box, your request will still work, but is sent via the proxy server.</li>
		<li>If the API doesn't support CORS: leave the check box cleared. The request is routed via the Community Manager developer portal's proxy server.</li>
		<li>If you're not sure: leave the check box cleared.</li>
	</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="tc_two_log_entries_one_call">Why do I sometimes see two log entries for one Test Client call?</h2>
<p>If the API you're using supports basic or detailed logging of transactions, the calls you make to an API in Test Client are recorded on the metric logs for your app.</p>
<p>In general, there is one log entry per transaction. However, if the API call you're making in Test Client returns more complex media types that cannot be accurately displayed in the Raw and Formatted tabs, yet the browser can determine the media type, the browser makes a second call in order to be able to display the response, within an &lt;img&gt; tag, in the Pretty tab.</p>
<p>For example, let's say the API response is an image, but the media types for the operation are not specified. Test Client makes the first call, and an image is returned. Test Client makes a second call and, as a result, can display the image in the Pretty tab.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="tc_response_headers">Why do I see extra response headers in the Headers tab?</h2>
<p>The API you're testing might have special functionality associated with it to allow API requests from other domains; this is called <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_cors">CORS</a> (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). If the API supports CORS, you might see some additional headers in the response, along the lines of the examples below:</p>
<pre>
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, api_key, Authorization</pre>
<p>The above headers do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</strong>: Controls which domains are authorized to send requests. * means all domains.</li>
	<li><strong>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</strong>: Controls which HTTP verbs are allowable for API calls.</li>
	<li><strong>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</strong>: Controls which request headers are allowable for API calls.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="tc_colors">What is the color coding for the Test Client results?</h2>
<p>When you run operations in Test Client, the HTTP code for the response message is color coded as shown below.</p>

<h2 id="tc_ss_not_displayed">The app's shared secret is not displayed, or is encrypted. How do I use Test Client?</h2>
<p>Display of the app's shared secret is affected by one of the security settings for the Community Manager developer portal, controlled by the Site Admin. Shared Secret display can be <strong>Plain Text</strong> or <strong>Encrypted</strong>. In some cases, it might not be displayed at all. For more information about this setting, see <a href="site_admin_settings.htm#settings_config_apps_01">General App Settings</a> (Site Admin help).</p>
<p>If the API requires the app to authenticate, you'll need to have the app's shared secret in order to use the API in Test Client. If the shared secret is displayed, there's nothing extra you'll need to do. However, if the Community Manager developer portal's security settings are set to encrypt the shared secret, the value is not populated in the <strong>Setup</strong> dialog (see <a href="#tc_settings_security">Test Client: Setup (Authentication Settings)</a> above). In this case, you&rsquo;ll need to get the encrypted shared secret value, decrypt it, and paste the decrypted value into Test Client. Depending on your role, you'll need to do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you&rsquo;re an API Admin: Contact the App Admin for the shared secret value.</li>
	<li>If you&rsquo;re an App Admin, you'll need to get the shared secret from the <strong>App Details</strong> page and decrypt it. For instructions, see <a href="app_create_app_security.htm#ss_view">How do I view a shared secret?</a></li>
	<li>If you don't have a shared secret on the platform: Contact the App Admin and request a Shared Secret value for the app.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you have the decrypted shared secret, paste it into the <strong>Shared Secret</strong> field and save the app values in Test Client. You can then continue with testing the app/API.</p>
