<a name="what_is_a_license"></a><h3>What is a license?</h3>
<p>A license is a tailored API access package designed by the Business Admin/API Admin and offered to the app developer. A license includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One or more License Terms, each of which can include multiple scopes, giving access to specifically designated operations, and multiple quality of service (QoS) agreements.</li>
  <li>One or more legal agreements applicable to the license.</li>
</ul>
<p>API visibility is controlled at the license level and also at the Scope level. This means that the license feature can be used not only to package an API for the purposes of monetization, development, or for any other reason, but also to control visibility so that only members of designated user groups can even see portions of the API (and the associated documentation). API access is granted at the license level.</p>
<p><strong>Defining a License:</strong></p>
<p>Business Administrators can define a license in the <em>Administration &gt; Licenses</em> section using the <strong>+Add License</strong> function. As a prerequisite to defining a license you must have scopes pre-defined (via the <em>Administration &gt; Scopes</em> section) as scopes are a component of the license definition.</p>
<p>Some points to note when defining a license:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It's best to define scopes first. You can define a license without adding Scopes, but a license is meaningless without at least one scope assigned to it.</li>
  <li>As part of the license, you must define one or more <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_licenseterm">license terms</a>.</li>
  <li>One or more Scopes can be assigned a license using the <strong>Add Scope</strong> function.</li>
  <li>Each Scope can be tailored using the <strong>Select  Scope</strong> function (you can select or deselect specific tiers within the Scope).</li>
  <li>After you save the license, the API Admin must specify that the API uses licenses, and must map scopes to operations within the API (scope mapping). If the license is private, the API Admin must also create a Private API Group or invite other groups to access the API and specify that the groups have access to that license. Once those steps are complete, applicable licenses are available for app developers to select in the API Access Wizard.</li>
</ul>

<a name="what_is_a_license_term"></a><h3>What is a license term?</h3>
<p>A license term is a building block for a license. A license is made up of one or more license terms plus, optionally, one or more legal agreements. When defining a license, you define one or more license terms. Each license term is unique to the license that it is a part of; license terms do not exist separately from licenses.</p>
<p>A license term includes two components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The access that is being offered in terms of what exactly the user is being given access to (<a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_scope">scope</a>); for example, access to read-only operations, access to credit card operations, access to all operations.</li>
  <li> The level of access in terms of quality of service and/or volume of transactions (<a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_qospolicy">QoS policy</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p> Each license term includes one or more scopes plus, optionally, the quality of service limits/policies to be applied to all scopes in the license term. Scopes apply to both visibility and access; policies apply only to access. To have any impact, a license term must include at least one scope.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_are_the_visiblity_rules_for_a_license"></a><h3>What are the visibility rules for a license?</h3>
<p>The following visibility rules apply for a license:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Public licenses are always available  for selection in the API Access Request wizard.</li>
  <li>Private licenses are only visible to an app developer if the developer's visibility scope for an API version includes that license. This happens when a group that the developer is a member of has access to the license.</li>
  <li>A public API can have a private license. In this scenario, all users see the parts of the API that are not included in the private license. The operations that are in the private license, and their corresponding documentation, are only visible to users who have explicit access to all scopes within that license.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_a_scope"></a><h3>What is a scope?</h3>
<p>A scope is the bridge between the top level of the hierarchy, a license, and the bottom level, an operation. At the business level, the Business Admin defines the scope with a name and basic attributes. Then, at the API level, the API Admin assigns specific operations to one or more scopes for the API. These operations are included in any license that the scope is assigned to.</p>
<p>The app developer never sees scopes; the developer is offered one or more licenses offerings that have been defined for the API. However, scopes are a building block of licenses.</p>
<p>Operations are assigned to scopes; scopes and QoS policies are assigned to license terms; license terms and legal agreements are assigned to licenses.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_add_a_scope"></a><h3>How do I add a scope?</h3>
<p>You can configure a scope using the <strong>Add Scope</strong> function in the <em>Administration &gt; Scopes</em> section of the platform. Some things to note about scopes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The only required fields are Name and Short Description. You can also add a more detailed description in the Full Description field.</li>
  <li>Specify the visibility. A public license is visible to app developers when requesting API access for an app.</li>
  <li>Choose whether anonymous access will be allowed to your Sandbox or Production environments (not recommended)</li>
  <li>If you are using OAuth you can also specify whether the scope should be included in the OAuth default scope (used if no scopes are specified in the request) and whether user authorization is required.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Delete</strong> function allows you to delete a scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Edit a scope</strong>. Highlight the scope and then, in the right pane, click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Add a child scope</strong>. Highlight the scope and then, in the right pane, click <strong>Add Child</strong>. You can define multiple levels of scope hierarchy.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete a scope</strong>. Highlight the scope and then, in the right pane, click <strong>Delete</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Scopes can only be configured by Business Administrators.</em></p>
<a name="scope_add"></a>
<h5>To add a scope:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Site Administration &gt; Licenses</em>. The <em>Scopes </em>screen displays.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add Scope</strong>. In the right panel, specify the following:
<ul>
  <li>Name (required)</li>
  <li>Short Description (required)</li>
  <li>Full Description</li>
  <li><strong>Visibility</strong>: If a scope has public visibility, anything mapped to the scope (operations or documents) is visible to all users including anonymous users. If a scope has private visibility, any part of the API mapped to the scope is visible only if the user is a member of one or more groups that either have been invited with a visibility scope containing the private scope or else have been invited with unrestricted visibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Anonymous access</strong>: If anonymous access is allowed for a scope, operations that are mapped to the scope can be used by apps that do not identify themselves to the gateway with any credentials. The app does not even need to be registered in the platform. We recommend not allowing anonymous access to your API. For more information, see <a href="api_admin_api_publishing.htm#what_is_anonymous_api_access">What is Anonymous API Access?</a></li>
</ul></li>
  <li>If you are using OAuth, specify the two OAuth values:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Default Scope</strong>: If OAuth is being used and an app's grant access request does not specify scopes, all scopes that have the Default scope option checked are included in the scope of the grant.</li>
      <li><strong>User Authorization Required</strong>: If the scope is being used for OAuth, user authorization is required for scope access. If an OAuth grant includes all scopes with this option disabled, the provider does not require the resource owner to authorize the grant request.</li>
    </ul>
 </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The scope is now available for selection when creating a license.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_modify_a_scope"></a><h3>How do I modify a scope?</h3>
<p>You can modify a scope using the <strong>Edit</strong> function in the <em>Administration &gt; Scopes </em>section of the platform.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When a scope is active you cannot modify it.</p>
<h5>To edit a scope:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Site Administration &gt; Scopes</em>. The <em>Scopes </em>screen displays.</li>
  <li>In the left panel, select the  scope you want to edit, and click <strong>Edit</strong> in the right panel. Change the values as needed. For explanations of the fields and their values, refer to <a href="#scope_add">To add a scope</a>. There are also explanations of key fields on the page itself (available on hover).</li>
 <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. The modified scope is now available for selection when creating a license.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_add_a_license"></a><h3>How do I add a license?</h3>
<p>You can configure a license using the <strong>Add License</strong> function in the <em>Administration &gt; Licenses </em>section of the platform:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scopes must be predefined in the <em>Administration &gt; Scopes </em>section so that they are available for selection when defining the license.</li>
  <li>Quality of Service (QoS) policies must be defined in <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy_manager">Policy Manager</a>.</li>
  <li>The process of configuring a license involves assigning a name and description, configuring the approval level for Sandbox and Production Access (Auto Approved or Approval Required), setting <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">Visibility</a> (Public or Private), and defining one or more license terms, each of which includes one or more scopes and QoS policies that will apply to the license (in the <em>Admin &gt; Licenses</em> section).</li>
  <li>You can upload legal agreements during the license creation process.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Add Term</strong> function allows you to add a license term. A license can include multiple terms, each of which can include one or more scopes and QoS policies.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Delete</strong> function allows you to delete a license definition line item.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Licenses can only be configured by Business Administrators.</em></p>
<a name="license_add"></a><h5>To add a license</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Site Administration &gt; Licenses</em>. The <em>Licenses </em>screen displays.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add License</strong>. Specify the Name, Description, Visibility (Public/Private), and Sandbox Access and Production Access options you would like to assign to the license definition.

If the API itself is private but the scope is public, the resources are visible to all users who have been invited to the API.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Private</strong>: A private license is visible only to an app developer who is a member of one or more groups invited to have <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_visibility">visibility</a> into the license.
<p>If an app developer's visibility scope for an API version includes a private license, that developer will have the option to choose that license when requesting API access.</p>
<p>If a license is private, only users that have the license in their visibility scope can access the API documentation/downloadable files that are mapped to the license.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The API admin must make sure that the documentation is appropriately tagged. If it is not, it will not be visible even to authorized individuals.

<a name="how_do_i_add_a_policy"></a>
<h3>How do I add a policy to a license?</h3>
<p>The Licenses feature uses policies as a component when building the license definition; policies are an optional component in license terms. However, policies are defined outside the platform, in <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy_manager">Policy Manager</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as the policy is defined in the <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_api_gateway">API Gateway</a>, it is available for selection when you click <strong>Add License</strong> ( <em>Administration &gt; Licenses</em>) and add a license term to the license.</p>
<p>If you want to create licenses but the policies are not set up yet, you can go ahead and set up the licenses without the policies, and then go back and add the policies when they're available.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_modify_a_policy"></a><h3>How do I modify a policy?</h3>
<p>You can modify a policy by changing the policy definition in <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy_manager">Policy Manager</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_delete_a_policy"></a><h3>How do I delete a policy?</h3>
<p>If you want to delete a policy, it must be done in <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_policy_manager">Policy Manager</a>, where the policies are set up. Note that you can only delete a policy that is not in use.</p>
<p>You <strong>cannot</strong> delete a policy if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a license definition that references the policy.</li>
  <li>There is an active or pending API access contract that references the policy.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how_do_i_assign_a_license_to_an_api"></a><h3>How do I assign a license to an API?</h3>
<p>The API Admin or Business Admin links license definitions to an API by completing the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the API setup, making sure the <strong>Choose Licenses</strong> checkbox is selected.</li>
<li>From the API page, assigning scopes to the API (scope mapping).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once those steps are complete, any licenses that include those scopes in the license definition are presented to the app developer for selection when the app developer initiates an API access request.</p>
