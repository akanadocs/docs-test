<a name="what_is_moderation_and_how_does_it_work"></a><h3>What is moderation and how does it work?</h3>
<p>Apps and groups on the platform have their  own <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_forum">Forum</a>. All platform users who have visibility of the resource can see the Forum.</p>
<p>The Forum includes items such as discussions, reviews, and team invitations.</p>
<p>In addition, each user has his/her own Forum, accessible from the top navigation bar. The user Forum includes all forum entries relating to apps, APIs, or groups the user is associated with.</p>
<p>The platform has settings that allow the Site Admin to control whether discussions, reviews, and comments are automatically published when written, or must be moderated. If moderation is specified, when a user adds one of those items it is in an <strong>Unpublished</strong> state until reviewed. At that point, it is visible only to the author and to users with the right to approve the Forum entry.</p>
<p>The Moderator can publish, reject, or delete the item.</p>
<p>Once it is published, the Moderator can unpublish an item or can delete it.</p>
<p>With reviews, the author can modify the review. In this scenario, the original review remains published while the revised review is going through the approval process. Once the revised review is approved, the original review is deleted. The new review has a marks count of 0.</p>
<p>For information about who can moderate and how it is done, see <a href="#who_can_moderate">Who can moderate?</a> and <a href="#how_do_i_turn_on_moderation_in_the_platform">How do I turn on moderation in the platform?</a></p>

<a name="how_do_i_turn_on_moderation_in_the_platform"></a><h3>How do I turn on moderation in the platform?</h3>
<p>By default, discussions, reviews, and comments are auto-published. Moderation is not required.</p>
<p>Moderation can be turned on by the Site Admin via the Settings pages. Each type of resource that allows moderation has a Publishing field that is set to one of two values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Auto-Published</strong>: when the discussion, review or other piece of user-generated content is written, it is automatically published with no moderation.</li>
  <li><strong>Approval Required</strong>: When it is written, it is placed in an Unpublished state and an entry appears in the Forum, where a moderator can review it and approve or refuse the publication request.</li>
</ul>
<h5>To turn on moderation for a specific type of resource in the platform:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Business Admin, Site Admin, or API Admin, and click the <strong>Administration</strong> quick filter (wrench icon).</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Forum</strong>.</li>
  <li>Choose the applicable settings page, find the Publishing field, and choose Auto-Published or Approval Required as explained above. This field is available on the following pages:
    <ul>
      <li>Comments</li>
      <li>Discussions</li>
      <li>Reviews</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  <li>For more information on the settings for these resources, refer to the applicable topic in <a href="site_admin_config.htm#h_configuration">Configuration</a>.</li>
  <li>Choose to save or open the export file.</li>

<a name="how_do_i_moderate_a_forum"></a><h3>How do I moderate a forum?</h3>
<p>If you have rights to moderate a forum you will see the Administration icon (wrench icon) in the top menu bar.</p>
<h5>To moderate a forum:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Business Admin, Site Admin, or API Admin, and click the <strong>Administration</strong> quick filter (wrench icon).</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Forum</strong>.</li>
  <li>If needed, choose from the controls at the top of the page to narrow down the forum entries displayed. See <a href="#what_functions_are_available_for_moderating_a_forum">What functions are available for moderating a forum?</a></li>
  <li>Review the content as needed, and click available buttons to approve or reject the forum entries.</li>
</ol>

<a name="how_do_i_enable_markdown_for_forum_entries"></a><h3>How do I enable Markdown for forum entries?</h3>
<p>The platform supports the use of Markdown to add rich text formatting, inline images, and downloadable files in user-generated Forum entries.</p>
<p>If enabled, Markdown is supported for discussions, tickets, alerts, reviews, and comments.</p>
<p>Markdown is enabled for each type of resource separately&#8212;so, for example, it might be enabled for discussions but not for comments.</p>
<p>The Site Admin controls this feature in the site settings. For more information, see <a href="site_admin_config.htm#how_do_i_enable_markdown_for_board_items">How do I enable Markdown for Forum items?</a> (Site Admin only).</p>
<p>For more information on using Markdown, see <a href="basics_forums.htm#h_markdown">Using Markdown</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_does_the_use_of_markdown_affect_forum_moderation"></a>
<h3>How does the use of Markdown affect forum moderation?</h3>
<p>If you're moderating a forum, and some or all of the forum entries use Markdown, you'll see the Markdown formatting and possibly inline images, links, and/or URLs. You'll also see the Source and View tabs.</p>
<p>By default, forum entries that include Markdown are displayed in View mode, so that you can see how the discussion, ticket, alert, review, or comment will appear to users once it's published. You can click to the Source tab to see the forum entry in plain text, including the Markdown and the link/file coding.</p>
<p>If one or more files were uploaded as part of the Markdown, you also have the option to download each file.</p>
<p>You can't change the Markdown, and the actions you can take with each forum entry are the same regardless of whether the forum entry uses Markdown or not.</p>
<p>For more information on the use of Markdown, inline images, links, and URLs in forum entries, see <a href="basics_forums.htm#h_markdown">Using Markdown</a>.</p>
