<h2 id="process_define">What is a process?</h2>
<p>A process is an ordered group of activities that can be performed by an API Gateway that supports the virtualization capability. The logic performed in a virtual service operation is defined as a process. When a message is received by the container, once the virtual service operation is identified, its process is executed. As determined by the activities in the process, down-stream services might be invoked. When the process is complete, a response to the original message is generated.</p>
<p>In Policy Manager, the <strong>Add Process Wizard</strong> allows you to define a library of reusable processes with common activities. For example, you might define a process to retrieve user information based on an account number, or to build a custom form.</p>
<p>In the Community Manager developer portal, you can define a custom process:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For a specific operation within a specific implementation of an API; see <a href="apiadmin_implementations.htm#api_impl_how_edit">How do I edit an API implementation?</a></li>
	<li>For use within a business organization; see topics below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Process Palette, you can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Define the sequence of messages as they flow through for each virtual service operation.</li>
	<li>Configure a variety of different types of activities, each represented by a separate icon in the Process Palette user interface, for achieving the results required for each operation.</li>
</ul>
