<a name="what_is_moderation_and_how_does_it_work"></a><h3>What is moderation and how does it work?</h3>
<p>Certain resources on the platform, such as apps, APIs, and groups, have their  own <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_board">Board</a>. All platform users who have visibility of the resource can see the Board.</p>
<p>The Board includes items such as discussions, reviews, and team invitations.</p>
<p>The platform has settings that allow the Site Admin to control whether discussions, reviews, and comments are automatically published when written, or must be moderated. If moderation is specified, when a user adds one of those items it is in an Unpublished state until reviewed. At that point, it is visible only to the author and to users with the right to approve the Board item.</p>
<p>The Moderator can publish, reject, or delete the item.</p>
<p>Once it is published, the Moderator can unpublish an item or can delete it.</p>
<p>With reviews, the author can modify the review. In this scenario, the original review remains published while the revised review is going through the approval process. Once the revised review is approved, the original review is deleted. The new review has a marks count of 0.</p>
<p>For information about who can moderate and how it is done, see <a href="#who_can_moderate">Who can moderate?</a> and <a href="#how_do_i_turn_on_moderation_in_the_platform">How do I turn on moderation in the platform?</a></p>

<a name="how_do_i_turn_on_moderation_in_the_platform"></a><h3>How do I turn on moderation in the platform?</h3>
<p>By default, discussions, reviews, and comments are auto-published. Moderation is not required.</p>
<p>Moderation can be turned on by the Site Admin via the Settings pages. Each type of resource that allows moderation has a Publishing field that is set to one of two values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Auto-Published</strong>: when the discussion, review or other piece of user-generated content is written, it is automatically published with no moderation.</li>
  <li><strong>Approval Required</strong>: When it is written, it is placed in an Unpublished state and an entry appears in the Forum, where a moderator can review it and approve or refuse the publication request.</li>
</ul>
<h5>To turn on moderation for a specific type of resource in the platform:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in as the Business Admin, Site Admin, or API Admin, and click the <em>Administration</em> quick filter (wrench icon).</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Moderate</strong>.</li>
  <li>Choose the applicable settings page, find the Publishing field, and choose Auto-Published or Approval Required as explained above. This field is available on the following pages:
    <ul>
      <li>Comments</li>
      <li>Discussions</li>
      <li>Reviews</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
