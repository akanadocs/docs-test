<a name="what_are_the_differences_between_site_admin_and_business_admin_roles"></a>
<h3>What are the differences between Site Admin and Business Admin roles?</h3>
<p>In a <a href="basics_glossary.htm#gl_tenant">tenant</a> scenario, a user who is a Business Admin for the tenant has full permission to all objects within the tenant business, including all apps and APIs.</p>
<p>The Site Admin is responsible for keeping the site running smoothly</p>
<p>Similarities and differences between these two roles are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Both roles can add and manage Business Admins.</li>
  <li>Only the Site Admin can add and manage Site Admins and site users.</li>
  <li>Only the Site Admin can add and manage domains.</li>
  <li>Only the Business Admin can export and import resource information.</li>
  <li>The Site Admin sets up configuration options for apps, APIs, and groups, and has access to activities relating to custom styles, site logins, and site content.</li>
  <li>The Business Admin can add, change, and delete Scopes and Licenses; the Site Admin can view them but cannot change them.</li>
  <li> Business Admins can add, change, and delete workflows but Site Admins can only view.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the relationship between a Site Administrator, Business Administrator, and API Owner?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When your platform is initially installed, configured, and deployed a Site Administrator is created at that time. Note that the default Site Administrator role is not automatically assigned the Business Administrator role.</li>
  <li>All other user accounts created via the platform are added to the Policy Manager instance where the tenant is defined.</li>
  <li>Each user account is automatically assigned Registered Users Group and API Owner role.</li>
  <li>The Site Administrator configures the  API Owner role based on the  visibility requirements of the tenant and intended usage. For example, if the intended usage of the platform was to allow users to add an API, the API Owner role would be configured with an &quot;Add&quot; privilege. If the intended usage of the platform was to not allow users to add an API, no privileges would be configured.</li>
  <li>Site Administrators that would like to grant additional API and App management privileges to specific users can do so by sending a Business Administrator invitation via <em>Site Administration &gt; Business Adm.</em> to selected platform users. For more information, see <a href="business_admin_overview.htm#what_roles_can_a_business_administrator_perform">What roles can a Business Administrator perform?</a></li>
  <li>Business Administrators are part of the Business Administrator group via <em>Site Administration &gt; Business Adm. </em>See <a href="business_admin_business_adm.htm#what_are_the_components_of_the_business_admin_page">What are the components of the
      Business Admin page?</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>Note that only Business Administrators can add APIs. Site Administrators are not authorized to add APIs but can manage Business Administrators.</li>
</ul>
