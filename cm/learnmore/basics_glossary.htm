	<dt id="gl_actiondashboard">Action Dashboard</dt>
	<dd>In 2020.1.0 and later, the feature previously named Dashboard was renamed to Action Dashboard and modified.</dd>
	<dd>The user's Action Dashboard is the first page the user sees after logging in. The Action Dashboard includes information relating to apps and APIs the user is associated with. An individual user's Action Dashboard is an aggregation of all the Forum entries from all the resources that the user is following. An individual user can modify the types of information that are displayed on his/her Action Dashboard, in the <strong>Profile</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> page. See also <a href="#gl_actiondashboardentry">Action Dashboard entry</a>.</dd>
	<dd>Navigation: <strong>Dashboard</strong> &gt; <strong>Action Dashboard</strong>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_actiondashboardentry">Action Dashboard entry/item</dt>
	<dd>An informational item that appears on a user's Action Dashboard. The entries on a specific user's Action Dashboard are Forum entries for resources the user is following. An entry on the Action Dashboard can be any of the following: <a href="#gl_alert">Alert</a>, <a href="#gl_apiaccessrequest">API Access Request (Contract Request)</a>, <a href="#gl_discussion">Discussion</a>, or <a href="#gl_ticket">Ticket</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_additionalproperties">additionalProperties property in Swagger</dt>
	<dd>Per the Swagger specification, the Schema Object supports the JSON Schema <strong>additionalProperties</strong> property, with limitations. In the Akana API Platform, the HTTP Message Validation policy allows you to control support for the <strong>additionalProperties</strong> property via the <strong>Allow additional properties by default</strong> field. Support for additional properties is enabled by default, but you can disable it.</dd>
	<dd>For more information, see <a href="../../ag/policies/policy_op_http_message_validation.htm#http_msg_validation_allow_addnl_props">Allow additional properties by default</a> (Policy documentation).</dd>


	<dt id="gl_admin">admin (group)</dt>
	<dd>In the context of an <a href="#gl_apiscopegroup">API Scope Group</a>, an Admin is the top-level group member, and can perform any functions associated with the group. For more information, see <a href="basics_groups.htm#group_roles_admin">What can a group Admin do?</a></dd>


<dt id="gl_aggregatepolicy">Aggregate Policy</dt>
<dd>An Aggregate Policy is a collection of two or more policies included in one. The Aggregate Policy can be configured in two ways:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>AND</strong>: messages must meet <strong>all</strong> the policies defined</li>
			<li><strong>OR</strong>: messages must meet <strong>at least one</strong> of the policies defined</li>
		</ul></dd>
<dd>For example, in the Community Manager developer portal, an Aggregate Policy might include the <a href="#gl_pl_AtmosphereApplicationSecurityPolicy">AtmosphereApplicationSecurityPolicy</a> and the OAuth policy, with configuration of OR. The message to the API must meet the requirements of one of the policies.</dd>
<dd>The platform supports Aggregate Policies for <strong>Operational</strong> and <strong>Compliance</strong> policy types. Test Client supports the Operational Aggregate Policy. For more information, see <a href="api_admin_testing_tc.htm#tc_configsettings_aggregatepolicy">Test Client security settings: Aggregate Policy</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_aggregationpipeline">Aggregation Pipeline (in MongoDB)</dt>
	<dd>In the context of MongoDB, the aggregation pipeline is:</dd>
	<dd>"a framework for data aggregation modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into aggregated results."</dd>
	<dd>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/" title="Link to MongoDB site, Aggregation Pipeline definition" target="_blank">Aggregation Pipeline</a> on the MongoDB site.</dd>

	<dt id="gl_ajax">Ajax</dt>
	<dd>An abbreviation for <strong>Advanced JavaScript and XML</strong>&#8212;A term for a set of related web development techniques that can be used together to update parts of a webpage without reloading the entire page.</dd>


	<dt>Akana API Gateway</dt>
	<dd>See <a href="#gl_gateway">gateway</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_akana_api_platform">Akana API Platform</dt>
	<dd>The Akana API Platform is a set of features, previously installed separately, that are now integrated and are installed as a single product. It is made up of three different components: <a href="#gl_policy_manager">Policy Manager</a>, <a href="#gl_community_manager">Community Manager</a>, and <a href="#gl_network_director">Network Director</a>. Each component plays a unique role. For instance, Policy Manager is a set of applications that provide runtime policy enforcement, management, security, service configuration, and runtime governance.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_akana_platform">Akana Platform</dt>
	<dd>The Akana Platform is the underlying set of files that supports the <a href="#gl_akana_api_platform">Akana API Platform</a>. When installing the product, the Akana Platform installation comes first.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_alert">alert</dt>
	<dd>A type of <a href="#gl_actiondashboardentry">Action Dashboard item</a> designed to inform app or API administrators about an issue such as an SLA (Service Level Agreement) violation.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_allowlist">allowlist</dt>
	<dd>A list of terms that are allowed, when there is an active <a href="#gl_denylist">denylist</a> in effect.</dd>


<dt id="gl_amqp">AMQP</dt>
	<dd>Acronym for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol; an open-standard protocol for message orientation, queueing, and routing. In the same way as other protocols, such as SMTP, HTTP, and FTP, that have defined the behavior of the provider and client so that different implementations are interoperable, AMQP is a wire-level protocol; this means that the data is sent as a stream of octets.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_anonymousaccess">anonymous access (to an API)</dt>
	<dd>With anonymous API access, users do not need to log in, or set up an app, to try out an API.</dd>
	<dd>Allowing anonymous access to an API endpoint in the Sandbox environment is useful if you would like to offer a preview of an API to developers without requiring users to create an app or sign up to the platform. For example, if you have a specific feature set you would like to expose as part of promoting your API, you can expose those operations in your API configuration, and allow anonymous access.</dd>
	<dd>Developers can read the documentation and access the API without signing up and requesting access to the API. If a developer tries out the API and likes it, he/she can then sign up to the platform, create an app, and request API access.</dd>
	<dd>Anonymous access is typically granted to API Sandbox endpoints, but it is generally not a standard practice to grant anonymous access to a Live endpoint.</dd>
	<dd><strong>Note</strong>: When <strong>Allow Anonymous Access</strong> is set to <strong>Yes</strong> for an API, viewing usage data for apps in the <strong>Overview</strong>, <strong>Charts</strong>, and <strong>Logs</strong> sections of <strong>APIs</strong> &gt; <strong>My APIs</strong> &gt; choose API &gt; <strong>Analytics</strong> is not supported. This applies whether or not an approved API Access Request exists for an app. The <strong>Analytics</strong> section still shows API usage data.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_anonymoususer">anonymous user</dt>
	<dd>A user who is browsing the platform without logging in. Anonymous users can see public content but cannot post to Boards, write comments or ratings, or create resources such as apps.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_api">API</dt>
	<dd>A key resource in the Akana API Platform. An API provides a business with a way of using the Internet to extend business capabilities to connect with new customers in new ways. In this context an API is a Web service exposed outside the enterprise, typically using RESTful design principles, and often with JSON content.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_apiaccessrequest">API access request</dt>
	<dd>A specific type of <a href="#gl_connectionrequest">Connection Request</a>; a request, initiated by an app team member, to establish a <a href="#gl_contract">contract</a> between the app and an API. An API access request governs the relationship between an app and an API for the life of the connection. When an app team member requests a connection to an API on behalf of the app, the API administrator is notified of the pending request and can approve or deny the request.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_apiadmin">API Administrator</dt>
	<dd>One of the <a href="#gl_role_group">roles</a> defined in the Akana API Platform is that of the API Admin. Each API must have at least one Admin, and can have more. The API Admin approves or rejects connection requests, moderates the API's <a href="#gl_forum">Forum</a>, views and manages alerts and trouble tickets, and manages documents, policies, and other information associated with the API. The API Admin can also view performance and usage data for the entire API, and can invite others to be Admins for the same API.</dd>
<dd>API Administrator and API Admin are the same role.</dd>
<dd><strong>Note</strong>: If a Business Admin assigns a user the API Administrator role in the context of a business organization, in <strong>Organizations</strong> &gt; <strong>Organization</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> (see <a href="bus_admin_org_roles.htm#roles_apiadministrator">What are the default roles for the API platform: API Administrator</a>), that role has full rights to view, add, modify, or delete an API, but does not have permission to view or modify the API Admin group. Only when a user creates the API, or is invited to the API Admin group, does the user have full rights both to the API and to the API Admin group.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_api_description_document">API description document</dt>
	<dd>An API description document is a document written in one of the API description languages supported by the API platform (<a href="#gl_oas30">OAS 3.0</a>, <a href="#gl_swagger_20">Swagger 2.0</a>, <a href="#gl_swagger_12">Swagger 1.2</a>, <a href="#gl_raml">RAML 0.8</a>, <a href="#gl_wsdl">WSDL</a>, or <a href="#gl_wadl">WADL</a>). In the Community Manager developer portal, you Scan add an API by uploading the API description document, and you can update an API by uploading a revised document. The platform takes the information in the API description document and uses it to present a visual display of the API in API Designer, as well as generating the API documentation.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_api_description_language">API description language</dt>
	<dd>One of the formal languages that provides a structured description of a RESTful web API. You can create an API using the API description document that describes that API. The platform supports the following API description languages: <a href="#gl_swagger">Swagger</a>, <a href="#gl_raml">RAML</a>, <a href="#gl_wsdl">WSDL</a>, and <a href="#gl_wadl">WADL</a>.</dd>
	<dd>For supported versions, go to <a href="../../sp/system_requirements/system_requirements_all.htm">System Requirements (all versions)</a> and choose your version. Then, go to the <strong>API description document formats</strong> section.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_api_board">API Forum</dt>
	<dd>The <strong>API Forum</strong> allows any member to post discussions about a specific API, or create trouble tickets about issues associated with the operation of a particular API.</dd>
	<dd>Navigation: <strong>APIs</strong> &gt; API Name &gt; <strong>Forum</strong></dd>


	<dt id="gl_api_gateway">API Gateway</dt>
	<dd>The Akana API Gateway provides service integration and gateway services for APIs. It bundles Akana <a href="#gl_policy_manager">Policy Manager</a> with one or more message handling intermediaries.</dd>
<!--<dd>Message handling intermediaries might include Network Director, Policy Manager for DataPower, or the Microsoft Intermediary./<dd>-->



<dt id="gl_api_owner">API Owner</dt>
<dd>Responsible for adding an API. In a scenario where a basic platform user cannot add APIs, a user who is assigned the role of API Owner can add APIs. The user who creates the API becomes the first <a href="#gl_apiadmin">API Admin</a>.</dd>



	<dt id="gl_apiscopegroup">API Scope Group</dt>
	<dd>A group directly associated with a specific version of a specific API, public or private, and created by an API admin for that API. </dd>
	<dd>An API scope group is uniquely related to an API. There are two types: <strong>Independently Managed</strong>, which can exist separately from the API, and <strong>Not Independently Managed</strong>, which is automatically deleted if the API is deleted.</dd>
	<dd>Each member has a group member role, as a <a href="#gl_member">Member</a>, <a href="#gl_leader">Leader</a>, or <a href="#gl_admin">Admin</a>. Each group can have multiple Admins, Leaders, and Members.</dd>
	<dd><strong>Note</strong>: In the past, we used the term Private API Group. However, since the licenses feature was implemented, API visibility is affected by multiple factors. For this reason, the term was changed to API Scope Group. We also used the term API Context Group.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_app">app</dt>
	<dd>An app (application) is a piece of software that delivers specific capabilities to its users. In the context of the Akana API Platform, an app is a piece of software that consumes one or more APIs.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_jws_appendix_f">Appendix F</dt>
	<dd>In version 2019.1.14 and later, the platform supports enforcing Appendix F (Detached Content of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#appendix-F" title="Link to Appendix F of the JWS specification" target="_blank">JWS specification</a> (Provider role only), in the JOSE Policy v2 (Unencoded Payload Support) configuration.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_app_board">app Forum</dt>
	<dd>The app <strong>Forum</strong> allows development team members to create private discussions with other team members about their specific application development projects. Team members can also create trouble tickets about issues associated with application development.</dd>
	<dd>Navigation: <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>My Apps</strong> &gt; choose app &gt; <strong>Forum</strong></dd>


	<dt id="gl_app_id">App ID</dt>
	<dd>When an app developer registers an app in the platform, it is assigned an App ID. The App ID is a unique identifier for your app within the platform. All API calls include the App ID.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_appteammember">app team member</dt>
	<dd>One of the <a href="#gl_role_group">roles</a> defined in the Akana API Platform is that of the app team member. Each app must have at least one team member and can have more. An app team member initiates <a href="#gl_contract">contract</a> requests, such as API access requests, moderates the app's <a href="#gl_forum">Forum</a>, and views and manages trouble tickets relating to the app. The app team member can also view performance and usage data for the app's API usage, and can invite others to be team members for the same app. All app team members have the same rights.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_a_record">A record (in DNS entry)</dt>
	<dd>A DNS entry for a website address includes an A record that maps the <a href="#gl_hostname">hostname</a> or <a href="#gl_cname">CNAME</a> to the IP address of the DNS entry.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_saml_ars">Artifact Resolution Service (ARS)</dt>
	<dd>In <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a>, a service that you must set up if you want to use the HTTP Artifact binding (supported for single sign-on SAML response messages). You can then use the service to retrieve the full message using the artifact. See <a href="#gl_saml_http_artifact">HTTP Artifact</a>.</dd>


	<dt>Assertion</dt>
	<dd>See <a href="#gl_saml_assertion">SAML assertion</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_saml_acs">Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) endpoint</dt>
	<dd>In <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a>, the endpoint where the service provider will receive SAML assertions from the <a href="#gl_identityprovider">identity provider</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_asset">asset</dt>
	<dd>A component, or resource, that can be created, used, reused, and acted upon. The API platform includes many asset types, including APIs, apps, services, schemas, policies, tenants, legal agreements, API access contracts, and others. The platform's use of this term is per the OMG Reusable Asset Specification (RAS) (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/RAS/2.2/PDF" title="Link to RAS specification version 2.2 PDF" target="_blank">http://www.omg.org/spec/RAS/2.2/PDF</a>). The specification is a set of guidelines and recommendations about the structure, content, and descriptions of reusable software assets.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_asymmetric_encryption">asymmetric encryption</dt>
	<dd>A form of encryption where data is encrypted and decrypted with two separate keys, a public key and a private key. For more information, see <a href="#gl_public_key_infrastructure">public key infrastructure</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_pl_AtmosphereApplicationSecurityPolicy">AtmosphereApplicationSecurityPolicy</dt>
	<dd>A policy used to identify (authenticate) an app that is attempting to consume an API, to determine whether or not the app is authorized to access the API. This policy type supports multiple mechanisms for the app to present its identity. For more information, see <a href="api_admin_policy_list.htm#pl_AtmosphereApplicationSecurityPolicy">Policy List: AtmosphereApplicationSecurityPolicy</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_atmoauthtoken">AtmoAuthToken</dt>
	<dd>A tenant-specific cookie. This is the platform's authorization token. The token is returned in the Set-Cookie response header. This cookie indicates the level of access allowed. It is valid only for 30 minutes and must be renewed at that time. It also includes other information, such as the APIs, apps, and groups the user is a member of. When any of this information changes, the token must be renewed.</dd>
	<dd>Because the AtmoAuthToken includes a lot of information about the user, in some cases, the token is long, and could potentially cause requests to fail if the server has a limitation on HTTP header length. For this reason, container configuration properties include authTokenMaxLength. When the AtmoAuthToken would be greater than the max length, the platform creates a mini auth token, and saves the full auth token in the database.</dd>


	<dt>authorization endpoint</dt>
	<dd>See <a href="#gl_oauth_authorizationendpoint">OAuth authorization endpoint</a>.</dd>


	<dt>Authorization Server URL</dt>
	<dd>See <a href="#gl_oauth_authorizationserverurl">OAuth Authorization Server URL</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_autoconnect">auto-connect feature</dt>
	<dd>The platform's auto-connect feature allows an API Admin to set up the API so that when a new app is created on the platform, a <a href="#gl_contract">contract</a> with the API is created automatically. The API Admin specifies the details of the access granted with the auto-connect feature, such as whether access is to the Sandbox or Live implementation, or whether access is limited to specific operations or a specific transaction volume (via the <a href="#gl_license">Licenses</a> feature, implemented with <a href="#gl_scopemapping">scope mapping</a>).</dd>


	<dt id="gl_avatar">avatar</dt>
	<dd>Within the platform, an avatar is an image that can be associated with a resource such as an app, API, user, or group.</dd>
</dl>



<h2 class="index" id="gl_alpha_b">B</h2>
<dl>
	<dt id="gl_base_path">base path</dt>
	<dd>In the context of an API, the base path is the part of the URL that is after the <a href="#gl_hostname">hostname</a> and is the same for all operations in the API.</dd>
	<dd>The base path always starts with a leading forward slash (/). If nothing is specified for the base path, it defaults to the leading forward slash. This is the host root.</dd>
	<dd>For an example, see <a href="#gl_base_url">Base URL</a> below.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_base_url">Base URL</dt>
	<dd>In the context of an API, the base URL is the combination of <a href="#gl_scheme">scheme</a>, <a href="#gl_hostname">hostname</a>, and <a href="#gl_base_path">base path</a> on the root level of the API. For example, in the Swagger Petstore API, the full URL for the <span class="apidoc_code">POST&#160;/pet</span> operation, which adds a pet, is <span class="apidoc_code">http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet</span>. The base URL is <span class="apidoc_code">http://petstore.swagger.io/v2</span>. This is constructed from these three elements:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Scheme</strong>: <span class="apidoc_code">HTTP</span></li>
	<li><strong>Host</strong>: <span class="apidoc_code">petstore.swagger.io</span></li>
	<li><strong>Base path</strong>: <span class="apidoc_code">/v2</span></li>
</ul>
</dd>


	<dt id="gl_saml_base_url">Base URL (SAML)</dt>
	<dd>In setting up the <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a> identity provider in Policy Manager, the platform provides a specific URL to be used for instances where the Identity Provider, when encountering an error, returns the error response to the default Service Provider endpoint rather than just showing the error on the authentication page. PingFederate is an example of an Identity Provider that returns an error response in this way.</dd>
	<dd>To construct the endpoint to be used for error responses, the platform needs to know the {protocol_<a href="#gl_scheme">scheme</a>}://{host}:{port} of the container where the SAML Web SSO domain is initialized. This is the base URL.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_basic_authentication">Basic authentication (HTTP)</dt>
	<dd>Basic authentication requires that users provide a valid user name and password to access content. All major browsers support this authentication method and it works across firewalls and proxy servers. The disadvantage of Basic authentication is that it transmits passwords across the network using weak encryption. You should use Basic authentication only when you know that the connection between the client and the server is secure.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_beanshell">BeanShell engine</dt>
	<dd>A scripting language. The API platform supports BeanShell engine for creating reusable scripts, useful for automating processes.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_jwt_token_access_bearer">bearer access token (access token)</dt>
	<dd>An access token that uses the standard and contains all the information the resource server needs to confirm the user&rsquo;s grant to the application. It has the following three-part structure, with period separators: <strong>Header.Payload.Signature</strong>. The platform's OAuth Provider domain can issue Bearer access tokens. An advantage of the Bearer access token is that the Resource Server can validate by itself without having to go back to the Authorization Server.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_jwt_bearer_assertion">bearer assertion</dt>
	<dd>Same as <a href="#gl_jwt_token_id">ID token (OpenID Connect)</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_bearertoken">bearer token</dt>
	<dd>Used in OAuth, the bearer token is a security token with the property that any party in possession of the token (the bearer) can use it. The bearer token is sent as-is in the API request, in the Authorization header. The platform's OAuth Provider domain supports Referenced Bearer (a simple bearer token) and <a href="#gl_jwt_token_access_bearer">bearer access token</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_pm_binding">binding</dt>
	<dd>In the context of Policy Manager, a binding is a reference to an external framework (interface) that defines how the WSDL user will reach the implementation of services. This reference specifies the protocol and data format to be used in the transmitting message defined by the associated interface.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_pm_bindingcategorygroup">binding category group</dt>
	<dd>In the context of Policy Manager, <a href="#gl_pm_binding">binding category</a> groups allow you to categorize service relationships with a higher level of granularity, and contain a list of business categories that describe specific business aspects of the Organizations, Services, tModels, Schemas, Interfaces, or Bindings.</dd>


	<dt>Board</dt>
	<dd>See <a href="#gl_forum">Forum</a>. In versions of the platform before 8.3, Forums for resources were called Boards.</dd>


	<dt>Board item</dt>
	<dd>See <a href="#gl_forumentry">Forum entry</a>. In versions of the platform before 8.3, Forum entries were called Board items.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_theme_bonita">Bonita theme</dt>
	<dd>The Bonita platform <a href="#gl_theme">theme</a> is similar to <a href="#gl_theme_simpledev">Simple Developer</a> theme, but includes read-only access to API information, including API details, API documentation, and more.</dd>
	<dd>For more explanation, and illustrations showing the differences, see <a href="basics_theme_bonita.htm">Bonita Theme</a> and <a href="basics_theme_simpledev.htm">Simple Developer Theme</a>.</dd>


<dt id="gl_bpel">BPEL</dt>
<dd>BPEL is an abbreviation for Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL), an OASIS standard executable language which is a standard format for specifying actions within a business process, used by web services.</dd>

<dt id="gl_bpel_file">BPEL file</dt>
	<dd>A file using the <a href="#gl_bpel">BPEL</a> language.  When the Site Admin or Business Admin creates an export file from the platform, such as an API export file, the <a href="#gl_packagefile">export ZIP file (package file)</a> includes BPEL files.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_broadcast">broadcast</dt>
	<dd>Used in connection with configuration of the platform's search feature. Broadcast configuration is appropriate for scenarios where the client/server relationship is 1 to many. The scope is <strong>subnet</strong>. At startup, the node sends a message to all possible destinations. Compare <a href="#gl_unicast">unicast</a> which sends the same data to a single network address and <a href="#gl_multicast">multicast</a> which sends the data to all <em>interested</em> destinations.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_businessadmin">Business Administrator</dt>
	<dd>One of the roles defined in the Akana API Platform is that of the Business Administrator. A business can own one or more APIs and apps, and must have at least one Administrator. The Business Administrator automatically has administrator rights over all the APIs and apps owned by the business as well as all the users who are part of the business. For more information, see <a href="bus_admin_overview.htm#bus_admin_roles">What roles can a Business Administrator perform?</a></dd>
</dl>



<h2 class="index" id="gl_alpha_c">C</h2>
<dl>
	<dt id="gl_casiteminder">CA SiteMinder</dt>
	<dd>CA SiteMinder&reg; is a popular commercial access management product. The platform supports use of CA SiteMinder for login or for OAuth support.</dd>


	<dt>callback URL</dt>

	<dt id="gl_cer_file">CER file</dt>
	<dd>A digital identity certificate file, generated by an authorized Certificate Authority in response to a request (<a href="#gl_csr_file">CSR</a>).</dd>
	<dd>When uploading app credentials in the Community Manager developer portal, the app developer can upload either a CER file or a CSR file.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_certificate">certificate</dt>
	<dd>The digital certificate, issued by a Certificate Authority, which includes information necessary to the successful implementation of security with a public and private key pair. The certificate proves the ownership of the public key, and because the Certificate Authority is a trusted entity, the certificate is trusted.</dd>
	<dd>The digital certificate generally includes the following information:
	<ul>
<li>The certificate holder's public key.</li>
<li>Information about the certificate holder.</li>
<li>Information about the certificate authority.</li>
<li>Information about the certificate: Issue date, expiration date, and serial number.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
	<dd>In the context of the Community Manager developer portal, a digital certificate can be issued by a commercial trusted <a href="#gl_certificateauthority">Certificate Authority</a> (CA), such as Symantec (VeriSign) or Comodo, or by the platform itself.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_certificateauthority">Certificate Authority (CA)</dt>
	<dd>For scenarios where asymmetric encryption is used, a Certificate Authority (CA) issues certificates and guarantees the validity of the binding between the certificate owner and its public key. The CA is a trusted authority, and any certificate issued by the CA identifies the owner of the certificate. Therefore, the private key that corresponds to the public key in the certificate is deemed to be known only to the specific owner. By requesting the public key from the CA, rather than from the key owner, there is an assurance that the key is indeed the valid public key for the key owner, that the key pair has not been compromised or revoked, and that the key owner holds the private key needed to decrypt messages that you encrypt with the public key, which the CA sends to you.</dd>
	<dd>The platform supports two Certificate Authority options for app developers. The Platform Tenant (Host) provides a simplified version of a Certificate Authority that can issue and renew X.509 certificates, or the app developer can import a certificate that was issued outside the platform.</dd>

	<dt id="gl_connectprovider">Connect provider</dt>
	<dd>In <a href="#gl_openidconnect">OpenID Connect</a>, the <a href="#gl_identityprovider">identity provider</a> is called the Connect provider.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_connection">connection</dt>
	<dd>A relationship between resources in the Akana API Platform&#8212;such as the API access relationship between an app and an API that it's using.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_connectionrequest">connection request</dt>
	<dd>A workflow process that governs the relationship between two resources for the life of the connection. It is a request to establish a <a href="#gl_connection">connection</a> between resources; for example, an <a href="#gl_apiaccessrequest">API access request</a> or a <a href="#gl_followrequest">follow request</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_connectordomain">connector domain</dt>
	<dd>In the context of the platform, a connector domain is an independent domain that provides authentication services; for example, Google&reg;, Facebook&reg;. Users can log in by authenticating with the connector domain rather than signing up as platform users.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_container">container</dt>
	<dd>An Akana container instance performs a specific web service management function in an API Gateway deployment. Instances have a unique Instance Name, Description, and <a href="#gl_listener">Listener</a> configuration relative to the deployment requirements.</dd>
	<dd>The container mediates web service message exchanges between service consumers and service providers. It enforces policies, monitors and reports performance metrics and events, integrates services through virtualization, and provides auditing capabilities. It provides the runtime execution of the API Platform's capabilities.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_contextpath">context path</dt>
	<dd>The context path for an API implementation is the last part of the base URL, after and including the slash (/); for example, in http://www.acmepaymentscorp.com/api, /api is the context path. This makes the endpoint unique to the API. By default, in the Akana platform, each implementation must have a unique path. If an API does not use a vanity <a href="#gl_hostname">hostname</a>, you don't need to specify a context path; the platform creates a path that is already unique to the API implementation.</dd>

	<dd>The context path could also be just a slash (generally called <strong>root</strong>).</dd>
	<dd>The API settings in <strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>APIs</strong> include a setting that allows the Site Admin to disable the validation for a unique context path. If the setting is disabled, multiple APIs can have the same context path. These APIs must have unique URLs, or the results will not be as expected. For example, in some scenarios, all APIs hosted on the platform might have vanity hostnames, so validation for unique context path is not needed. For more information, see <a href="site_admin_settings.htm#settings_api_general">General API Settings</a> (re the Site Admin setting) and <a href="apiadmin_implementations.htm#context_path_define">What is the context path and how do I make sure I have the right context path for my API implementation?</a> (Site Admin help).</dd>


	<dt id="gl_contract">contract</dt>
	<dd>A specific type of <a href="#gl_connection">connection</a> that defines a consumption relationship between an app and an API. When an app admin (app team member) wants the app to be able to consume an API, he/she initiates a request for API access. The API access relationship is a contract, and is subject to an approval workflow. The contract is requested by the app team member and is approved or rejected by the API admin; it can then be cancelled or suspended by the API admin or cancelled by an app team member.</dd>
	<dd> The contract governs access rights and QoS (Quality of Service) policies for all transactions between the app and the API. It also provides a convenient way of collecting and presenting metrics and usage data.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_contractrequest">contract request</dt>
	<dd>A request for a <a href="#gl_contract">contract</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_coordinateduniversaltime">Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</dt>
	<dd>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), also called Zulu time, is the primary time standard in general use. It essentially equates to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), but is more scientifically precise. In the Akana API Platform API, time values are represented in the standard UTC date/time format <strong>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ</strong>. Example: <strong>2013-12-31T15:45:00-04:00Z</strong>. In the Community Manager developer portal user interface, in <strong>Analytics</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong>, date formats use the local browser time, adjusted to UTC.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_cors">CORS</dt>
	<dd>Acronym for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. CORS allows users to access resources from within the browser serving a web page, defining a way in which the browser and the server can interact to determine whether or not to allow the cross-origin request (request from a different domain). If an API doesn't support CORS, and a request comes from another domain, the request could be refused as coming from a source which is not trusted.</dd>
	<dd>The platform includes a policy, <strong>CORSAllowAll</strong>; if this policy is assigned to an API implementation, all cross-origin requests to the API implementation are allowed.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_crosssitescripting">cross-site scripting (XSS)</dt>
	<dd>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to add a client-side script into an input field on a web page, such as a review or comment field. Other users accessing the page can then unknowingly execute the malicious script.</dd>
	<dd>(Version 2019.1.0 and later): The platform has some built-in cross-site scripting prevention; for example, by default, certain input fields, such as app, API, and group <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Summary</strong>, and <strong>Description</strong> fields and forum discussions and tickets, check for scripting keywords and do not accept them. The Site Admin can configure additional cross-site scripting keywords on the <strong>Security Settings</strong> page (<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong>). See <a href="site_admin_settings.htm#xss_keywords">Keywords for cross-site scripting prevention</a>.</dd>

	<dt id="gl_csr_file">CSR file</dt>
	<dd>Acronym for Certificate Signing Request; a request for a digital identity certificate, generated and sent to a certificate authority.</dd>
	<dd>When uploading app credentials, the app developer can upload either a CER file or a CSR file.</dd>
	<dd>Because the platform supports CSR import, the app developer does not need to get a signed certificate from a CA. Instead, the developer can generate a CSR from the key pair that he/she created, and can import that directly.</dd>
	<dd>When a CSR is imported, the platform uses its internal Certificate Authority to create the actual certificate, the CER file, from the request. Therefore, in order to support CER, the platform's own certificate authority must be configured.</dd>
	<dd>See also: <a href="#gl_cer_file">CER file</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_csrf">CSRF (cross-site request forgery)</dt>
	<dd>In a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack, a malicious user exploits the fact that an authorized user has already authenticated with another site and has the site's cookie in their browser cache. Malicious code from one browser tab can leverage the authentication already granted in another tab to execute actions unknown to the authorized user.</dd>
	<dd>The platform includes a feature to help prevent CSRF attacks. For more information, see <a href="site_admin_config.htm#what_is_the_csrf_prevention_feature">What is the CSRF prevention feature?</a> (Site Admin help).</dd>


	<dt id="gl_csrf_token">CSRF token</dt>
	<dd>A platform token that is used only if the CSRF prevention feature is in effect. The CSRF token is sent when the user logs in, and can be used in making subsequent API calls to protect against CSRF attacks. For more information, see <a href="site_admin_config.htm#what_is_the_csrf_prevention_feature">What is the CSRF prevention feature?</a> (Site Admin help).</dd>


	<dt id="gl_csrf_tokencookie">Csrf-Token cookie</dt>
	<dd>A platform cookie that is used only if the CSRF prevention feature is in effect. The value of the Csrf-Token cookie is sent as a custom header value in request messages to protect against CSRF attacks. For more information, see <a href="site_admin_config.htm#what_is_the_csrf_prevention_feature">What is the CSRF prevention feature?</a> (Site Admin help).</dd>


	<dt id="gl_csv">CSV</dt>

	<dt id="gl_custom_en_us_json">custom_en-us.json file</dt>
	<dd>The Site Admin, in customizing the site, might implement a <strong>custom_en-us.json</strong> file with customization information in it. If this file exists, the platform implements the information in the file; if it doesn't exist, the platform uses the defaults. Specific customization tasks require specific entries in this file, which is uploaded to the <strong>/resources/theme/{theme_name}/locales</strong> folder for the applicable theme.

Regardless of where the API platform feature is running, when an object is indexed, the data for that index is in the data node.
When a user is searching, the data is accessed from the data node.</dd>
	<dd>For the Site Admin, in configuring the <a href="#gl_elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> search feature, setting up a container as a data node indicates that the search index will be stored at that location.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_es_embedded_mode">Elasticsearch embedded mode</dt>
	<dd>Initially, Elasticsearch embedded mode was offered as a short-term option to help customers to migrate from Compass to Elasticsearch. It was never the recommended option, and is no longer supported.</dd>
	<dd>(Information for Site Admins) In Elasticsearch embedded mode, all you need to do is install the embedded feature in one or more containers. In this mode, there is no external software needed. Elasticsearch runs within each container it's installed in.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_es_master_eligible_node">Elasticsearch master eligible node</dt>
	<dd>(Information for Site Admins) A master eligible node is one that <strong>can</strong> become a master of the cluster.
There is always a cluster, even if there is only one node, so a single node will always be master eligible.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_es_shard">Elasticsearch shard</dt>
	<dd>The <a href="#gl_elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> search feature can be configured so that the search index is stored in multiple index partitions, called shards. &quot;Elasticsearch distributes shards amongst all nodes in the cluster, and can move shards automatically from one node to another in the case of node failure, or the addition of new nodes.&quot;</dd>
	<dd>For more information, refer to the Elasticsearch glossary of terms: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/glossary.html#glossary-shard" title="Elasticsearch glossary definition for shard" target="_blank">https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/glossary.html#glossary-shard</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_es_standalone_mode">Elasticsearch standalone mode</dt>
	<dd>(Information for Site Admins) With Elasticsearch standalone mode, your installation will need to include a standalone external Elasticsearch server. Just as with a relational database, you'll need to provide the software and hardware required.</dd>
	<dd>If you choose to run Elasticsearch in standalone mode, like a database server, all containers running the Akana API Platform can use it. In this scenario, it's important to provide a cluster capability to help prevent outage.</dd>
	<dd>Generally, in this scenario, all containers are working as <a href="#gl_es_client_node">client nodes</a>. There is no <a href="#gl_es_master_eligible_node">master eligible node</a> or <a href="#gl_es_data_node">data node</a> within the product.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_saml_entity_id">Entity ID</dt>
	<dd>In <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a>, a unique identifier for an entity. A SAML entity can be a Service Provider or an Identity Provider.</dd>
	<dd>As a service provider, you define the Entity ID. When setting up your account with the Identity Provider you must specify the Entity ID, which must be unique within the IdP so that the IdP can identify your Service Provider.</dd>
	<dd>The Entity ID is used as the value of the &lt;Issuer&gt; element inside the SAML protocol message. In an authentication request, the &lt;Issuer&gt; element contains the Entity ID of the Service Provider; in the SAML response, it has the Entity ID of the Identity Provider.</dd>
	<dd>From the perspective of the Service Provider, the Entity ID is analogous to the client_id in OAuth.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_enum">enumeration (of users)</dt>
	<dd>The term user enumeration, user enum, or simply enum refers to a security vulnerability that allows an unauthorized user to compile a list of valid user accounts that are authorized to log in to an application. For example, if an unauthorized user can try to sign up with an existing email address, and the application returns a message that an account already exists for that email address, the application is giving away information.</dd>
	<dd>The platform includes enhanced security settings that can be activated to help prevent enumeration of users.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_environment">environment</dt>
	<dd>A state defined by a workflow that corresponds to a software lifecycle stage (for example, Dev, Test, QA, Production).</dd>
	<dd>An Environment has its own representation, or data model, for an API. and the assets that support that API. A customer may have several Environments in which the same API exists. Each Environment serves a different purpose such as development, testing, staging, or finally serving the business (production). Environments are typically chained together in an order of use, reflecting the development lifecycle. For example, development is before testing. An API is created first in the development Environment, and then in the test Environment. Changes to an API are made in the development Environment before being made in the test Environment.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_environment_data">environment data</dt>
	<dd>The <a href="#gl_promotion_package">Promotion Package</a> holds the data that needs to be promoted from the source environment to the target environment. This includes the environment data: the portion of the Source environment's data model that needs to be promoted.

	<dt id="gl_oauth_extensiongranttype">extension grant type</dt>
	<dd>In addition to the four standard grant types, the OAuth 2.0 specification defines Extension Grant Types. These are governed by the OAuth specification, which says:</dd>
	<dd>&quot;<em>The client uses an extension grant type by specifying the grant type using an absolute URI (defined by the Authorization Server) as the value of the "grant_type" parameter of the token endpoint, and by adding any additional parameters necessary.</em>&quot;</dd>
	<dd>A Bearer Assertion is an extension grant type that is generally used when the app already has an Assertion that represents the resource owner. The app sends the Assertion to the Authorization Server's Token Endpoint to get an access token for later use.</dd>
	
	
	<dt id="gl_external_link">external link</dt>
	<dd>In the context of various message boxes in the Community Manager developer portal that support user-generated content, for example in <a href="#gl_forum">forums</a> for apps, APIs, and tickets, the platform includes two security settings. One determines whether <a href="#gl_markdown">Markdown</a> is supported for formatting content and uploading files, and another determines whether external links are supported in Markdown content. These are in the Site settings (<strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong>) for various resources that have forums.</dd>
	<dd>The Site Admin might choose to restrict links to external sites for security reasons, by leaving external link support disabled, while allowing formatting and uploaded files by enabling the Markdown setting.</dd>

	<dd>Unique ID for a specific tenant, in a federation (multi-tenant) scenario; for example, <strong>acmepaymentscorp</strong>. The FedmemberID is the last part of most IDs in the Community Manager developer portal. Same as TenantID.</dd>
	<dd>In the Community Manager developer portal user interface, one way to find out what the FedmemberID is for your installation is to go to your own profile page (from the menu at the top right, click <strong>Profile</strong>), and look at the URL. On the <strong>Profile Details</strong> page, the last part is <strong>user/{ID}.{fedmemberid}/profiledetails</strong>. For example: <strong>user/69e3ac04-a94b-48ae-988c-a490e4de07e1.acmepaymentscorp/profiledetails</strong>. In this example, <strong>acmepaymentscorp</strong> is the FedmemberID.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_follow">follow</dt>
	<dd>The concept of following a resource on the platform is similar to the same concept in Twitter. When a user chooses to follow a resource, notifications relating to that resource are posted to the user's Action Dashboard to keep the user informed. There is also a separate list of resources that the user is following. For example, if there are many APIs on the platform, and the user is only interested in two or three, the user can choose to follow those specific APIs. They are displayed in a separate list, <strong>APIs you are following</strong>, making them easier to find. The same principle applies to all resources that can be followed: apps, APIs, and groups.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_followrequest">follow request</dt>
	<dd>A specific type of <a href="#gl_connectionrequest">Connection Request</a> used to establish a <a href="#gl_follow">follow</a> relationship between a user and a <a href="#gl_resource">resource</a> that can be followed. Currently, only apps, APIs, and groups can be followed.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_forum">forum</dt>
	<dd>In the Akana API Platform, every resource, such as an app or API, has a Forum that displays different item types, such as tickets and discussions, for the resource. Users with approved connections to the resource can post items to the resource's Forum according to privileges. For example, a member of a specific app team can post items to the Forum for that app. Users with approved connections also see relevant <a href="#gl_forumentry">Forum entries</a> in their Action Dashboard.</dd>
	<dd>A Forum is a way of sharing information and content in the platform. Forum types include: <a href="#gl_alert">Alerts</a>, <a href="#gl_contractrequest">Contract Requests</a>, <a href="#gl_discussion">Discussions</a>, <a href="#gl_groupmembershiprequest">Group Membership Requests</a>, <a href="#gl_review">Reviews</a>, <a href="#gl_ticket">Tickets</a>.</dd>
	<dd>Forum types and <a href="#gl_forumentry">Forum entry</a> types are essentially identical. The difference is in implementation; the Forum is viewed by the Business Admin or Site Admin in <strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;<strong>Forum</strong>), and is an overall view of Forum entries from all boards on the platform.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_forumentry">Forum entry</dt>
	<dd>An individual content contribution by a specific user, to one of the <a href="#gl_forum">Forum</a> types. A Forum entry can be an Alert, API Access Request (Contract Request), Discussion, Group Membership Invitation, or Ticket.</dd>
	<dd> In versions of the platform before 8.3, Forum entries were called Board items.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_forwardproxy">forward proxy</dt>
	<dd>In general, a forward proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary, generally between client requests and another server.</dd>
	<dd>In the context of the API platform, if an API is using the platform as a proxy, calls from clients to the API are sent to the platform and, from there, redirected to the API live endpoint. The Community Manager developer portal includes a configuration setting (in <strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Admin</strong> &gt;<strong>Site</strong>) that allows the Site Admin to limit forward proxy activity to one or more specified hosts. See <a href="site_admin_site.htm#settings_config_site">How do I configure site settings?</a></dd>
	<dd>Test Client uses a forward proxy approach to allow testing with APIs when the API has CORS restrictions. For more information, see <a href="api_admin_testing_tc.htm#tc_options_request">Why does Test Client send an HTTP OPTIONS request before the call to the API endpoint?</a></dd>

	<dd>"Rotation of signing keys can be accomplished with the following approach. The signer publishes its keys in a JWK Set at its jwks_uri location and includes the kid of the signing key in the JOSE Header of each message to indicate to the verifier which key is to be used to validate the signature. Keys can be rolled over by periodically adding new keys to the JWK Set at the jwks_uri location. The signer can begin using a new key at its discretion and signals the change to the verifier using the kid value. The verifier knows to go back to the jwks_uri location to re-retrieve the keys when it sees an unfamiliar kid value. The JWK Set document at the jwks_uri SHOULD retain recently decommissioned signing keys for a reasonable period of time to facilitate a smooth transition."</dd>

	<dt id="gl_oauth">OAuth</dt>
	<dd>OAuth is an open standard security protocol for authorization that allows you to share private resources stored on one site with another site without having to share credentials. One advantage of OAuth is that it supports both authentication and authorization in such a way that an application does not need to give access to the user's credentials. For example, in the platform you can sign in using your Facebook credentials, or on the API Details page you can share an API to Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. These elements of the platform are configured as private resources.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_accesstoken">OAuth access token</dt>
	<dd>In OAuth, an access token is essentially a pass, a credential that gives authorization to access the requested and approved resource or resources for as long as the access token remains valid. In some cases, access tokens can be renewed by means of a <a href="#gl_oauth_refreshtoken">refresh token</a>; in some cases, they cannot. For more information, refer to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749" target="_blank">the OAuth 2.0 specification</a> (external site).</dd>
	<dd>For more information on access tokens, see <a href="api_admin_oauth_support.htm#what_is_an_access_token">What is an access token?</a></dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_authorizationcode">OAuth authorization code</dt>
	<dd>With the OAuth <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_authorizationcode">2.0 Authorization Code grant type</a>, the resource owner (consumer; for example, the app user) is redirected to the Authorization Server and gives authorization for the app to access the resource. The Authorization Server then redirects the consumer back to the client app with an authorization code. The client app presents this authorization code, along with the app's authentication credentials, back to the Authorization Server, requesting an <a href="#gl_oauth_accesstoken">access token</a> (and optionally a <a href="#gl_oauth_refreshtoken">refresh token</a>). The client then uses the access token to call the service on behalf of the resource owner. A refresh token can be used to extend the lifetime of this session.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_authorizationendpoint">OAuth authorization endpoint</dt>
	<dd>The endpoint for the OAuth Authorization Server. This is the endpoint on the Authorization Server where the resource owner provides credentials, such as username and password, in and grants authorization to the client app to access the resources or a specified subset of the resources.</dd>
	<dd>When setting up an OAuth domain, Site Admins must specify this value. Additionally, if an API is using a third-party OAuth provider rather than an OAuth domain set up on the platform, the API Admin must specify this value in the OAuth setup wizard. For more information, see <a href="api_admin_oauth_support.htm#what_are_the_oauth_20_endpoints_and_how_do_they_work">What are the OAuth 2.0 endpoints and how do they work?</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749" target="_blank">the OAuth 2.0 specification</a> (external site).</dd>

	<dt id="gl_oauth_authorizationserver">OAuth Authorization Server</dt>
	<dd>In an OAuth implementation, the Authorization Server collects the resource owner's credentials, gets the resource owner's permission for the app to access the resources, and passes back the authorization token to the app so that the app can then access the resources.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_authorizationserverurl">OAuth Authorization Server URL</dt>
	<dd>As part of setting up the OAuth domain, the Business Admin must specify the Authorization Server URL. This is the URL that the browser for the resource owner (app user) will be accessing for the OAuth grant. It is the URL at which the OAuth Provider accesses the requests, for both Authorization Endpoint and Token Endpoint.</dd>
	<dd>The URL must be accessible to all the apps and end users that might use APIs that are referencing the OAuth domain. The Authorization Endpoint and Token Endpoint for OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0 use different paths, according to the applicable OAuth specification. Firewalls and DNS servers must be set up for this URL so that end users and apps can access the URL.</dd>
	<dd>Site Admin information: Because the platform can support multiple OAuth Providers, it is important that each OAuth Provider has a different Authorization Server URL (for both Authorization Endpoint and Token Endpoint).</dd>
	<dd>As well as the Site Admin entering the authorization server URL in the domain setup, it is important that the network team makes the necessary changes to direct the requests to this URL to the containers where the Akana OAuth Provider feature is installed. This might include additional steps such as adding a DNS entry or configuring the load balancer if the URL is a virtual endpoint on F5.</dd>

	<dd>The grant provisioning UI has the potential to include the logo for the application, pulled from the application information, and for the OAuth provider, as set up in the Branding tab in the OAuth Provider domain setup.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_granttypes">OAuth grant types</dt>
	<dd>OAuth 2.0 supports four different grant types; each has a different process flow. Grant types are designated as <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_2legged">2-legged</a> or <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_3legged">3-legged</a> depending on the number of parties involved. The 2-legged grant types are <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_clientcredentials">Client Credentials</a> and <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_passwordcredentials">Resource Owner Password Credentials</a>; the three-legged grant types are <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_authorizationcode">Authorization Code</a> and <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_implicit">Implicit</a>.</dd>
	<dd> For more information on OAuth grant types (for API admins) see <a href="api_admin_oauth_support.htm#what_grant_types_does_oauth_support">What grant types does OAuth support?</a> and <a href="api_admin_oauth_support.htm#how_does_oauth_2legged_and_3legged_authorization_work">How does OAuth 2-Legged and 3-Legged Authorization work?</a></dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_grant_2legged">OAuth grant types: 2-legged</dt>
	<dd>The number of legs used to describe an OAuth request refers to the number of parties involved; 2-legged or 3-legged. When the client is also the resource owner, it is a 2-legged flow. OAuth 2.0 includes the following 2-legged grant types; <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_clientcredentials">Client Credentials</a> and <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_passwordcredentials">Resource Owner Password Credentials</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_grant_3legged">OAuth grant types: 3-legged</dt>
	<dd>The number of legs used to describe an OAuth request refers to the number of parties involved. The most common process flow includes three parties; a client, a server, and a resource owner. This is a 3-legged flow. OAuth 2.0 includes the following 3-legged grant types; <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_authorizationcode">Authorization Code</a> and <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_implicit">Implicit</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_grant_authorizationcode">OAuth grant types: Authorization Code</dt>
	<dd>A <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_3legged">3-legged</a> OAuth 2.0 grant type: An authorization code is returned to the client through a browser redirect after the resource owner gives consent to the OAuth Authorization Server. The client then exchanges the authorization code for an access token. Resource owner credentials are never exposed to the client app.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_grant_clientcredentials">OAuth grant types: Client Credentials</dt>
	<dd>A <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_2legged">2-legged</a> OAuth 2.0 grant type: The client presents its own credentials to the OAuth Authorization Server in order to obtain an access token. This access token is either associated with the client's own resources, rather than a specific resource owner, or is associated with a resource owner for whom the client is otherwise authorized to act.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_grant_implicit">OAuth grant types: Implicit</dt>
	<dd>A <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_3legged">3-legged</a> OAuth 2.0 grant type: An access token is returned to the client through a browser redirect in response to the resource owner authorization request. This grant type is suitable for clients that do not support keeping client credentials confidential (for use in authenticating with the OAuth Authentication Server) such as client applications implemented in a browser using a scripting language like JavaScript.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_grant_passwordcredentials">OAuth grant types: Resource Owner Password Credentials</dt>
	<dd>A <a href="#gl_oauth_grant_2legged">2-legged</a> OAuth 2.0 grant type: The client collects the resource owner's password and exchanges it at the OAuth Authorization Server for an access token, and often also a refresh token. This grant type is suitable in cases where the resource owner has a trust relationship with the client, such as its computer operation system or a highly privileged application, since the client must discard the password after using it to obtain the access token.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_provider">OAuth provider</dt>
	<dd>The platform's OAuth provider fulfils various standard OAuth provider functions such as: collecting authorizations from end users to apps, issuing tokens to apps, and validating tokens received in API requests.</dd>
	<dd>The platform's OAuth Provider domain relies on authentication being performed by an external Identity Provider. The OAuth process flow doesn't perform authentication, but relies on it. The platform's OAuth Provider can connect to various identity stores, such as LDAP and CA Site Minder. The portal also supports interfacing with a proprietary identity store.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_refreshtoken">OAuth refresh token</dt>
	<dd>In OAuth 2.0, certain grant types support use of refresh tokens to facilitate longer access periods. This is useful in scenarios that extend over time, such as a regular monthly payment amount.</dd>
	<dd>In OAuth 1.0a, once an <a href="#gl_oauth_accesstoken">access token</a> is generated it is valid until revoked by the user. OAuth 2.0 introduces expiration of access tokens and adds a second type of token, a refresh token, that can be used in conjunction with the access token to allow users to give long-term permissions but yet maintain security. This process helps ensure that if a specific access token is compromised, a new one can be generated from the refresh token, which can be stored in the database on the server.</dd>
	<dd>The access token grants immediate access but only for a limited time. The access token comes with two additional values: expires_in, which indicates the life of the access token, and refresh_token which can be used to get a new access token when the current token expires. Additional user approval is not needed, but the expiration and renewal add security to the process. When (or before) the access token expires, the refresh token can be used to generate a new access token.</dd>
	<dd>For more information, see <a href="api_admin_oauth_support.htm#what_is_a_refresh_token">What is a Refresh Token?</a></dd>


	<dt id="gl_oauth_resourceserver">OAuth resource server</dt>

	<dt id="gl_oauth_tokenendpoint">OAuth token endpoint</dt>
	<dd>In OAuth 2.0, the token endpoint is the endpoint on the <a href="#gl_oauth_authorizationserver">Authorization Server</a> where the client app sends the authorization code, client ID, and client secret and receives in exchange an access token which allows the app to access the approved resources. For more information, see <a href="api_admin_oauth_support.htm#what_are_the_oauth_20_endpoints_and_how_do_they_work">What are the OAuth 2.0 endpoints and how do they work?</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749" target="_blank">the OAuth 2.0 specification</a> (external site).</dd>

	<dt id="gl_openidconnect">OpenID Connect</dt>
	<dd>An identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol that allows the client to verify the identity of an end-user based on authentication by an Authorization Server. OpenID Connect was released in February 2014 and is gaining popularity. For example, Google has moved from OpenID to OpenID Connect for products such as the Google+ API, used by the platform's Google login domain. For more information, see <a href="http://openid.net/connect/" target="_blank">Welcome to OpenID Connect</a> (external site).</dd>

	<dt id="gl_openidconnect_provider">OpenID Connect provider</dt>
	<dd>The platform's OAuth Provider domain can also function as an OpenID Connect Provider. In this scenario, the platform manages OAuth grants, token validation, and all other activities associated with the OAuth provider role. It supports issuing JWT tokens from the Authorization Endpoint or Token Endpoint. It supports the UserInfo Endpoint, and supports the Well-Known Configuration endpoint for metadata. Both digital signatures and encryption are supported for JWT tokens.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_orchestration">orchestration (API)</dt>
	<dd>An orchestration creates a service that is implemented with a process, rather than being simply a proxy of another service. The orchestration process itself might (but does not necessarily) invoke multiple APIs, and might aggregate responses or take other actions to process a request. A <a href="#gl_mockservice">mock service</a> is a type of orchestration. An orchestration is at an operation level, not a service level.</dd>

This supports such activities as installing or uninstalling, starting, stopping, or updating one or more containers without stopping the entire system.</dd>
	<dd>In the context of the API Platform, specific features are installed in specific OSGi containers. For example, the API Platform might be installed in one OSGi container, the underlying infrastructure in another container, and the Network Director, the component that actually manages the traffic, in another.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_overloaded_operation">overloaded operation (API)</dt>
	<dd>An overloaded operation is one that has two or more implementations that have the same basic URL but with different arguments or, commonly, different media types. Often, there might be two operations that share the same path and HTTP verb but have different media types for Consumes (request media type) and Produces (response media type) elements.</dd>
	<dd>For example, the platform API itself has a small number of overloaded operations that return essentially the same information, but in two different formats depending on the media types used. In these examples, if the response media type is <strong>application/json</strong> or <strong>application/xml</strong>, the response is in the form of an RSS channel, and with the same path and HTTP verb, if the media type is <strong>application/vnd.soa.v81+json</strong> or <strong>application/vnd.soa.v81+xml</strong>, the response is in the form of a model object.</dd>

	<dd>The Client Redirection URI is the client's URI to which the authorization server sends the user-agent back once the user has granted (or denied) access to the resources.</dd>
	<dd>In general, a redirection endpoint or URL is a URL that an application provides to another app, when directing the user to the second app to perform some function and then return the user once the function is complete. For example: 
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Login</strong>: If the user is logging in with Google, the platform directs the user to Google and provides a redirect URL. When Google has authenticated the user, Google redirects the user back to the platform using the redirection URL.</li>
			<li><strong>OAuth. Facebook example</strong>: if an app is requesting access to one or more of the user's Facebook resources, such as the Calendar, the app directs the user to a Facebook authorization page, and provides a redirect URL. Facebook authenticates the user, collects the user's permission for the app to access the resources, and then uses the redirect URL to return the user to the app. In this example, Facebook is the identity provider and also the OAuth Provider.</li>
			<li><strong>Platform OAuth Provider</strong>: as part of registering with the OAuth Provider, the app developer must register the app's redirection URI on the <strong>App OAuth Details</strong> page. When the app is requesting access to resources on behalf of the end-user, the end-user is directed to the authorization page and then, after authenticating and authorizing, is seamlessly sent back to the redirection endpoint. The app can then, having access to the user's resources, provide the requested functionality to the user.</li>

Differentiating between users in terms of how they are added allows the implementation of custom workflows that grant different privileges to different types of users. For example, the Site Admin could implement a custom workflow so that a managed user cannot change the user profile but a registered user can.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_code_user_registration">registration code</dt>
	<dd>A unique code generated and sent to a specific user in an email if the Site Admin adds the user (currently supported only via the API). The code is only valid for the account it is generated for, and expires after a pre-set period.</dd>

	<dt id="gl_reset_css">reset.css</dt>
	<dd>In Web-based applications and web pages that use CSS styling, a stylesheet called <strong>reset.css</strong> is often used to reset the styles of core HTML elements, such as headings and lists, to a consistent baseline. Custom styles are then applied as a next step.</dd>
	<dd>The reason this is important is that there are inconsistencies in the way that different browsers interpret basic styles. Resetting to a consistent baseline, and building from there, helps ensure a consistent user experience across different browsers.</dd>

	<dt id="gl_scope">scope (with licenses)</dt>
	<dd>A subset of a <a href="#gl_license">license</a>. A scope is the bridge between the top level of the hierarchy, which is a license, and the bottom level, an operation. At the business level, the Business Admin defines the scope with a name and basic attributes. Then, at the API level, the API Admin assigns specific operations to one or more scopes for the API. These operations are included in any license that the scope is assigned to.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_scope_oauth">scope (OAuth)</dt>
	<dd>In the context of <a href="#gl_oauth">OAuth</a>, a scope is a permission setting that limits access to the resource; for example, an app consumer grants permission to view an account balance so that the app can then summarize multiple account balances for the consumer. By granting a specific scope, the consumer (the app's user) is not granting full access to the resource, but only partial access. For example, there could be a scope to view/retrieve data about the resource and a different scope to modify the resource.</dd>
<dd>In the platform, a scope value for an API version defines a subset of resources to which permission can be independently granted.</dd>

	<dd>Defining scopes for an API allows the API administrator to control the granularity of API access granted to an app. When scopes are defined, app owners can request access to specific resources they want to access, and API owners can grant access to specific resources they want to share.</dd>
	<dd>The OAuth Provider can also specify which scopes are required and optional in messages. The API Admin chooses the provider and then specifies which optional scopes apply to the API, and the level of granularity (to specific operations, multiple operations, or all operations).</dd>


	<dt>scope, dynamic</dt>
<dd>See <a href="#gl_pm_dynamicscope">dynamic scope</a>.</dd>
	
	
	<dt>scope group</dt>

Same as <a href="#gl_apiscopegroup">API Scope Group</a>.</dd>
	
	
	<dt id="gl_scopemapping">scope mapping</dt>
	<dd>If your API is using the Licenses feature, scope mapping is the key to defining which portions of your API will be available for which licenses. The scopes and licenses themselves are defined by the Business Admin, but at the API level you determine which operations are assigned to which scopes. This in turn determines which licenses will be available to app developers requesting access to your API.</dd>
	
	
	<dt id="gl_script">script</dt>
	<dd>In the context of the API Platform, a script is a reusable sequence of commands that can be used to automate the execution of tasks associated with managing the platform and its resources.</dd>
	<dd>You can build scripts for automating common tasks relating to your APIs. You can build a library of reusable scripts, which you can then import into a <a href="#gl_process">process</a>.</dd>

	<dd>The platform includes search functionality on certain specific pages and on platform-wide content. For example, a user can search on the apps list or APIs list for a specific app or API; the Site Admin can search for a specific user in the Users List. Search is available on many other areas of the user interface. Some examples: <strong>Forum</strong> posts, tickets, and alerts; help documentation (question mark at top right; then, Browse Docs).</dd>
	<dd>Search results are limited to those resources the user performing the search has permission to see. For example, a user who does not have access to a specific private API will not see it on the list.</dd>

	<dd>An application or collection of applications that all share, and trust, common security. The same security mechanism is used for all within the security domain, for authentication, authorization, and/or session management. A user who is authorized on one part of the security domain is considered authorized for other parts.</dd>
	<dd>In a tenant/partner scenario, all tenants share the same security domain and are considered to be trusted. So, for example, app owners on one tenant have access to API information on another tenant seamlessly and without any additional security authorization.</dd>

	<dt id="gl_sni">Server Name Indication (SNI)</dt>
	<dd>An abbreviation for Server Name Indication, SNI is an extension of the TLS protocol that allows a single server to connect multiple SSL certificates to one IP address. When the client attempts to connect to the server, the client indicates the <a href="#gl_hostname">hostname</a> it is attempting to connect to. The server sends the applicable digital certificate, which the browser then verifies; upon verification, the connection goes ahead.</dd>
	<dd>The API platform's support of SNI at the API/service level means that multiple certificates can be used for one HTTPS endpoint. This means that each API can use its own certificate for its own clients. The deployment zone must support HTTPS; the API implementation must have the <strong>Use Implementation's Key/Certificate for SSL</strong> option checked in the HTTPS tab for the deployment, and there must be a certificate in place for the implementation. For details, see <a href="apiadmin_implementations.htm#api_impl_sni">How do I set up my API to support SNI?</a> (API Admin help).</dd>
	<dd>The API platform also supports SNI at the tenant level; the Site Admin can upload a certificate for the specific theme.

	<dt id="gl_saml_service_provider">Service Provider</dt>
	<dd>In terms of <a href="#gl_saml">SAML</a>, the Service Provider (SP) offers a service to the user and allows the user to sign in by using SAML. When the user attempts to sign in, the SP sends a SAML authentication request to the Identity Provider (IdP). The IdP validates the request, authenticates the user, and creates a SAML assertion that represents the user's identity and, in some cases, sends additional information about the user in the form of associated attributes. The SAML assertion is digitally signed and encrypted and then sent back to the service provider that initiated the request.</dd>

	<dd>Acronym for Secure Hash Algorithm; a family of cryptographic hash functions including SHA-0, <a href="#gl_sha1">SHA-1</a>, SHA-2 (see <a href="#gl_sha256">SHA-256</a>), and SHA-3.</dd>
	
	
	<dt id="gl_sha1">SHA-1</dt>
	<dd>SHA-1 (Secure Hashing Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function, broadly used and trusted.</dd>
	<dd>When you hash a value with SHA-1, the hash function returns a 160-bit string. This is the message digest. The value is hashed and sent with the message; at the receipt point, the value is hashed again, and the two hash values are compared. When the two hash values match, it is a secure, reliable indication that the message hasn't changed; the message at the receipt point is an accurate duplication of the message at the send point.</dd>
	
	
	<dt id="gl_sha256">SHA-256</dt>
	<dd>Part of the SHA-2 family of algorithms developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to succeed SHA-1. Each is named according to the number of bits in the output; so, whereas SHA-1 has 160 bits in the hash output, SHA-256 has 256.</dd>

	<dd>Unrestricted API access for an app means that the <a href="#gl_contract">contract</a> is not limited to a specific license. The app has full access to all operations of the API. Compare: <a href="#gl_apiaccess_restricted">restricted API access</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_uri">URI</dt>
	<dd>A URI is a string of characters used to identify a name or resource. The term URI encompasses both <a href="#gl_url">URLs</a>, <a href="#gl_urn">URNs</a>, and other ways to indicate a resource. A URL is a type of URI that identifies a resource by specifying its location in the context of a protocol such as HTTP. </dd>
	<dd>For more information, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/" title="https://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/" target="_blank">https://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/</a>.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_url">URL</dt>
	<dd>A URL (Universal Resource Locator, a Web address) identifies a resource by specifying its location in the context of a particular access protocol; for example, HTTP or HTTPS. </dd>
	<dd>A URL is a type of Uniform Resource Identifier (<a href="#gl_uri">URI</a>).</dd>


	<dt id="gl_urn">URN</dt>
	<dd>A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a type of Uniform Resource Identifier (<a href="#gl_uri">URI</a>) that uses the <strong>urn</strong> scheme. </dd>
	<dd>A URN is not a locator, and is not necessarily associated with a specific protocol or access method. It is expected to be unique. An example of a URN naming system is the <strong>urn:isbn</strong> namespace, used for International Standard Book Numbers.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_user">user</dt>
	<dd>A person with a registered login ID to the Akana API Platform. All users must complete the registration process so that the system can gather required information about them before granting access. Each user can choose to define a new username/password combination that will be managed within the Akana API Platform, or can leverage the integration of the Akana API Platform&#160;with external security providers such as Facebook&reg; for authentication. By completing the signup process, each individual is assigned the role of User; users can then assume other roles, such as API Administrator or App team member (depending on platform settings).</dd>


	<dt id="gl_userinfoendpoint">UserInfo Endpoint (OpenID Connect)</dt>
	<dd>One of the two ways offered by the OpenID Connect specification for the app to learn information about the end user. The OpenID Connect Provider can publish a UserInfo endpoint, which is a protected resource that returns <a href="#gl_claim">claims</a> about the authenticated end-user.</dd>
	<dd>The client sends a request to the UserInfo Endpoint using an access token. The UserInfo Endpoint returns the user info to the client app.</dd>
	<dd>The OpenID Connect Provider can issue an ID Token (<a href="#gl_jwt_token">token</a>) from either the <a href="#gl_oauth_authorizationendpoint">Authorization Endpoint</a> or the <a href="#gl_oauth_tokenendpoint">Token Endpoint</a>.</dd>

	<dt id="gl_vanityhostname">vanity hostname</dt>
	<dd>A vanity <a href="#gl_hostname">hostname</a> is generally memorable, easy to understand, and clearly identifiable. An API might have an actual hostname that has more complexity, but maps to a vanity hostname that's easy for customers to remember. Customers can use the vanity hostname and do not even need to be aware that it isn't the actual API processing endpoint. The vanity hostname cannot include the underscore character.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_version">version</dt>
	<dd>Each <a href="#gl_app">app</a> or <a href="#gl_api">API</a> on the platform much have at least one version, and can have multiple versions. When a user creates an app or API on the platform, the first version is created automatically; when using the API, it's important to complete both actions. If there is only one app or API version, deleting that version also deletes the app or API.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_vertical_ellipsis_menu">vertical ellipsis menu</dt>

	<dd>For more information, see <a href="https://developer.visa.com/capabilities/vts" title="Link to Visa Token Service information" target="_blank">https://developer.visa.com/capabilities/vts</a> (external link).</dd>
	<dd>The Akana API Platform supports the VTS standard in the JOSE Profile-Driven Security Policy.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_visibility">visibility</dt>
	<dd>A setting that controls the types of users who can see a resource, such as an app, API, group, license, or scope, and any associated items such as discussions and tickets.</dd>
	<dd>There are three possible values. The first two are applicable to all resources that have visibility settings; the third is applicable only to apps, APIs, and groups.
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Public</strong>: anyone can see the resource, even anonymous users.</li>
			<li><strong>Private</strong>: the resource is restricted to those who have been specifically invited to have visibility of the resource, usually by joining a private group that has visibility of the resource.</li>
			<li><strong>Registered Users</strong>: the resource is visible to all users who have logged in, but is not visible to anonymous users.</li>

	<dd><strong>Note</strong>: The platform supports WADL for upload to create an API, but the platform then converts the WADL to JSON to create the API. It does not support download of an API description in WADL format.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_wellknownconfigurationurl">well-known configuration URL (OpenID Connect)</dt>
	<dd>In the <a href="#gl_openidconnect">OpenID Connect</a> protocol, the Well-Known Configuration URL is a specific URL published by the OpenID Connect provider. The platform can use this URL to retrieve other values it needs such as Authorization Server URL, Token Endpoint URL, UserInfo Endpoint URL, and security parameters used for tokens.</dd>
	<dd><strong>Note</strong>: If the well-known configuration URL uses the HTTPS protocol, the issuer certificate of the server must be trusted by the platform. Also, the issuer certificate of the server must be part of the <strong>cacerts</strong> file on the Akana API Platform container JRE.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_workflow">workflow</dt>
	<dd>Workflow defines the sequence of steps that are followed in a business process, including such related data as conditions (for example, a ticket must be resolved before it can be closed), state (for example, a ticket can have states of Open, Resolved, and Closed), or role (for example, a certain step can only be completed by an Administrator).</dd>
	<dd>Defining the workflow for a business process gives you control over the process and allows you to monitor and customize as needed to streamline the business process.</dd>
	<dd>The platform includes default out-of-the-box workflows for certain resources, such as API contracts, and allows you to customize the workflow for several key resources.</dd>


	<dt id="gl_workflowaction">workflow action</dt>
	<dd>Certain types of activities on the platform must be done in a specific sequence. These are often managed by workflows. Each workflow action changes the state of the resource.
