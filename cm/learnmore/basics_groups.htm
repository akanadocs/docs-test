<h2 id="h_about_groups">About Groups:</h2>




<h2 id="group_define">What is a group?</h2>
<p>On the platform, you can create a special-interest group of any time, and invite people to it. Creating a group enables collaboration between group members.</p>
<p>Groups have three levels of membership:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Admin</li>
	<li>Leader</li>
	<li>Member</li>
</ul>
<p>The person who creates the group becomes the first Admin, and can invite additional members to the group, as well as changing the role of an existing member. Groups can also be invited to have visibility of APIs; in this scenario, every member of the group has visibility, without having to request a contract with the API.</p>
<p>When a user is first invited to the group, on accepting the invitation, the user becomes a Member. From there, the member can be promoted to a Leader or Admin role.</p>
<p>All group members can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Collaborate on the group <strong>Forum</strong>. Depending on the <a href="#group_visibility">visibility</a> setting, the Forum is visible only to group members or to all platform users.</li>
	<li>See summary information about the group, on the <strong>Group Details</strong> page. See <a href="#group_details_page">What are the components of the Group Details page?</a></li>
	<li>Provide feedback on the group by providing a review or rating. See <a href="#h_group_reviews_ratings">Group Ratings and Reviews</a>.</li>
	<li>Have visibility of any APIs that the group has been invited to have visibility of.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="groups_types">What are the different types of groups on the platform?</h2>
<p>There are three variations of the standard platform group with the three-tier membership (Admin, Leader, and Member):</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Standalone (independent) group</strong>, created from the top menu bar: see <a href="#group_add">How do I add a group?</a></li>
	<li><strong>API Scope Group</strong>: a group that's created in the context of a specific API, if the develop portal is configured to support this feature. There are two types of API Scope Group:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Independently Managed</strong>: the group can exist separately from the API; if the API is deleted, the group is not deleted.</li>
			<li><strong>Not Independently Managed</strong>: the group exists solely in the context of the API; if the API is deleted, the group is automatically deleted also.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>For more information, see <a href="#h_api_scope_groups">API Scope Groups</a>.</p>
	</li>
	</ul>
<p>The platform also supports different types of group with a specific role, such as developers for a specific app, API Admins for a specific API, Business Admins, and Site Admins. These groups only have one membership level.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="group_membership_roles">What are the group membership roles?</h2>
<p>Groups have three levels of membership:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Member (third level; general group membership). See <a href="#group_roles_member">What can a group Member do?</a> below.</li>
	<li>Leader (second level; some additional permissions to group members). See <a href="#group_roles_leader">What can a group Leader do?</a> below.</li>
	<li>Admin (top level; full permission to manage the group). See <a href="#group_roles_admin">What can a group Admin do?</a> below.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="group_roles_member">What can a group Member do?</h2>
<p>When a user accepts a group membership invitation, the user initially has the status of Member.</p>

<h4 id="capabilities_member">Group Member capabilities</h4>
<p>Users with Member status and above have access to the following functions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Details</strong> (see <a href="#group_details_page">What are the components of the Group Details page?</a>)
		<ul>
			<li>View information about the group.</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<h2 id="group_roles_leader">What can a group Leader do?</h2>
<p>Once a user accepts the group membership invitation, a group Leader or Admin can make that member a Leader. The Leader has all the same capabilities as a group Member, as well as some additional functions, as shown below.</p>


<h4 id="capabilities_leader">Group Leader capabilities</h4>
<p>Users with Leader status have the following additional capabilities:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Members</strong>:

<h2 id="group_roles_admin">What can a group Admin do?</h2>
<p>When a user creates a group, that user becomes the first Admin, and has visibility of various functions associated with the group.</p>
<p>The Group Admin can perform all functions relating to the group.</p>


<h4 id="capabilities_admin">Group Admin capabilities</h4>
<p>Users with Admin status can perform all the functions of Members and Leaders, and have the following additional permissions:</p>
