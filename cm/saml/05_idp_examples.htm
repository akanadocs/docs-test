<a name="05_01"></a><h3>Identity Provider Configuration Example: SSO Circle</h3>
<p>If you are using SSO Circle as your SAML Identity Provider, you can set up the domain in Policy Manager and then configure your Service Provider account in SSO Circle at www.ssocircle.com. Since SSO Circle's Identity Provider metadata file is publicly available, you can copy and paste the metadata when setting up the domain in Policy Manager.</p>
<h5>To set up SSO Circle: high-level procedure</h5>
<ol>
  <li>In Policy Manager, set up SSO Circle as an Identity Provider. See To set up SSO Circle as an Identity Provider in Policy Manager below.</li>
  <li>In Community Manager, complete the setup by following the applicable procedure, depending on how you will be using the SAML domain:
    <ul>
      <li>As a login domain: see To enable a SAML login domain in Community Manager on page 18.</li>
      <li>As an OAuth provider domain: see To configure a SAML OAuth Provider domain in Community Manager on page 18.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
  <li>In your SSO Circle account, set up the platform as a Service Provider. See To set up the platform as a Service Provider using SSO Circle as the Identity Provider on page 40.</li>
  <li>In Community Manager, test to make sure your domain that uses the SAML Web Browser SSO feature works correctly:
    <ul>
      <li>As a login domain: see Testing the SAML Domain as a Login Domain on page 19.</li>
      <li>As an OAuth provider domain: see Testing the SAML Domain as an OAuth Provider Domain on page 19.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h5>Prerequisites:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Create an SSO Circle account at <a href="http://idp.ssocircle.com" title="http://idp.ssocircle.com" target="_blank">http://idp.ssocircle.com</a>.</li>
  <li>In the Akana Administration Console, install the SAML feature. See Step 1: Install the Plug-Ins to Support SAML Web Browser SSO on page 13.</li>
  <li>In Policy Manager, set up your PKI keys.</li>
</ul>
<h5>To set up SSO Circle as an Identity Provider in Policy Manager</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in to the Policy Manager Console.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Configure</strong> tab, click <strong>Security</strong>, and then click <strong>Identity Systems</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add Identity System</strong> to access the Add Identity System wizard.</li>
  <li>In the first page of the wizard, for identity system type, choose <strong>SAML Web Browser SSO</strong>. Provide name and description, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the second page of the wizard, Select <strong>SAML Identity Provider Configuration Method</strong>, choose to configure using the metadata document, and enter the metadata URL for SSO Circle: <a href="http://idp.ssocircle.com" title="http://idp.ssocircle.com" target="_blank">http://idp.ssocircle.com</a>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to access the SAML Identity Provider Configuration page, populated with the SSO Circle values as shown below.
    <p>{{uptohere image xxx <img src="images/xxx.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 17}}</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you chose to manually configure, you would need to enter the values on this page.</p></li>
  <li>Review the values, change the binding type if needed, and then click <strong>Next</strong> to access the Service Provider Configuration page, as shown below.
    <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/pm_wizard_ssocircle_04_spconfig.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 18}}</p>
  </li>
  <li>Enter the Service Provider configuration values, as needed:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entity ID</strong>: A unique ID that you define yourself, to identify your Service Provider in the SAML authentication request messages. When setting up your account with the Identity Provider you must specify the Entity ID, which must be unique within the IdP so that the IdP can identify your Service Provider; then, you set up the same value in Policy Manager.</li>
      <li><strong>Base URL</strong>: used to construct the default Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) endpoint, the endpoint where the Service Provider will receive SAML assertions from the Identity Provider. Must be the container address of the container where the SAML Web SSO feature is initialized (
        {protocol_scheme}://{host}:{port}). For more information, see Base URL on page 56.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication Request</strong>: Generally, you would choose to sign authentication requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication Response</strong>: choose from the two supported bindings.</li>
      <li><strong>Sign Metadata</strong>: SSO Circle does not support signing of the metadata, so leave this box cleared.</li>
      <li><strong>Supported Name-ID formats</strong>: all are checked by default.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to access the <strong>Manage PKI Keys</strong> page as shown below. Here you will set up the keys you will use to sign your SAML authentication request messages.
    <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/pm_wizard_ssocircle_05_pki.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 19}}</p>
  </li>
  <li>Choose to generate or import keys. If you choose <strong>Generate</strong>, provide values in the <strong>Certificate Details</strong> section. If you choose <strong>Import</strong>, you'll need to choose a key management option and provide keystore details as shown below.
    <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/pm_wizard_ssocircle_05_pki_import.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 20}}</p></li>
  <li>Specify additional key values if needed, and then click <strong>Next</strong> to access the <strong>Identity Mapping</strong> page as shown below.
    <p>{{uptohere image  <img src="images/pm_wizard_ssocircle_06_identitymapping.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 21}}</p>
  </li>
  <li>Choose whether to send the NameID as the subject of the SAML assertion, or to use an attribute: if needed, define the subject attribute name.</li>
  <li>Set up the Attribute Mapping values to correspond with those set up in your SSO Circle account, as shown below.
    <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/AttributeMapping_PM.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 22}}</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: SSO Circle supports only the above three attributes.</p></li>
  <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>. The Service Provider metadata file is generated and is available at the following URL: {http(s)}://{hostname}:{port}/saml/{sp_domain_name}/metadata. An example is shown below.
    <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/ssocircle_metadata_sp.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 23}}</p>
<p>You will use this to set up your Service Provider account with SSO Circle, as shown in the next procedure.</p>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure you get the metadata.xml file for the container that has Community Manager installed (if the domain will be used for Community Manager login) and/or has the OAuth Provider feature installed (if the domain will be used for Community Manager OAuth domain, for resource owner authentication for at  least one OAuth Provider).</p></li>
</ol>
<h5>To set up the platform as a Service Provider using SSO Circle as the Identity Provider</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in to your account at www.ssocircle.com.</li>
  <li>On the left, click <strong>Manage Metadata</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add New Service Provider</strong>. The page looks something like the below.
  <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/imagessocircle_01.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 24</p></li>
  <li>Provide the following information:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FQDN of the Service Provider</strong>: This value must match the Entity ID in the Policy Manager domain setup, <strong>Service Provider Configuration</strong> tab.</li>
      <li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Choose one or more out of the supported attributes displayed. With SSO Circle, you cannot modify attributes.</li>
      <li><strong>Metadata information</strong>: Copy the content of the metadata.xml file generated as a result of your domain setup (see the previous procedure). Be sure to <strong>exclude</strong> the XML processing instruction at the beginning of the file. Paste it in the box.
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Do not copy the XML from the browser window. Instead, click View Source and copy it from there, excluding the XML processing instruction at the top.</p></li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>. The XML is processed and you should see a Success message when processing is complete. If there are any errors, review your information and make sure all the values were set up correctly in Policy Manager, then try again.</li>
  </ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you make any changes, such as adding an OAuth Provider Domain in Community Manager, remember to update your SSO Circle account by pasting the revised metadata XML. If you are using the free SSO Circle account, you cannot edit your account; you'll need to delete the existing SP Metadata instance and then create a new one with the same name.</p>
<h5>To configure and test in Community Manager</h5>
<p>Once the setup in Policy Manager and the Identity Provider is complete, the steps to configure and test in Community Manager are the same for all Identity Providers. Follow the steps given earlier in this publication:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Community Manager configuration: see Step 6: Community Manager Configuration on page 17.</li>
  <li>Testing: see Step 6: Test on page 19.</li>
</ul>

<a name="05_02"></a><h3>Identity Provider Configuration Example: PingFederate</h3>
<p>This section provides additional information regarding setting up your Service Provider(SP) in PingFederate. In some cases, screen captures are provided; these are taken from PingFederate version 7.1.3.1 and are offered only as examples.</p>
<p>When registering with PingFederate as the SAML Identity Provider (IdP), note the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To set up the domain in Policy Manager, you must provide the metadata of the IdP. However, with PingFederate, the IdP metadata is not available until you have set up your Service Provider details in PingFederate. This is because PingFederate allows customization of the IdP for a specific Service Provider account, so the IdP metadata file is created as a result of configuring your account, rather than released as a static file as the SSO Circle file is. Therefore, you must do one of the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Create the SP connection in PingFederate first, export the metadata XML file, and then create the domain in Policy Manager.</li>
      <li>Configure the domain manually in Policy Manager, export the metadata XML file, then import the file into the PingFederate account.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>When setting up the domain manually, you have to assume some default values, and then use the same values when you set up the Service Provider connection in PingFederate.</p>
  <p>The example given here shows manual configuration of Policy Manager as per 2) above.</p></li>
  <li>If the security key you use for the account is issued by a third-party CA, you'll need to set up the CA as a trusted key issuer in Policy Manager.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Prerequisites:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>In PingFederate, choose <strong>Server Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Roles &amp; Protocols</strong>. Click the checkboxes to enable Identity Provider role and support SAML 2.0, as shown below.
    <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/pf_enablesaml20.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 25}}</p>
  </li>
  <li>In PingFederate, choose <strong>Federation Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Protocol Endpoints</strong>. Set up the applicable endpoint for Single Login service, and copy the binding URL (either Redirect or POST). You will use this in your Policy Manager setup.</li>
  <li>Conditional—if using HTTP Artifact for response binding: In PingFederate, when configuring security settings for the Artifact Resolution Service (<strong>Service Provider Credentials</strong> &gt; <strong>Credentials</strong> &gt; <strong>Configure</strong>, only available if HTTP Artifact is enabled), make sure you choose either HTTP Basic or Digital Signature for the authentication methods, and make sure that your choice matches you choice in Policy Manager setup, <strong>SAML Identity Provider Configuration</strong> page, as shown below.
    <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/pf_idpconfig_authentication.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 26}}</p>
  </li>
  <li>The platform does not support the SSL Client Certificate option.</li>
  <li>In PingFederate, if the artifact resolution service is used, if you choose HTTP Basic authentication, you'll need to set up the username and password in the Basic Authentication (Inbound) tab that appears when you choose that option, as shown below
    <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/pf_idpconfig_basicauth.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 26B}}</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>To set up PingFederate: high-level procedure</h5>
<ol>
  <li>In Policy Manager, set up PingFederate as an Identity Provider. See To set up PingFederate as an Identity Provider in Policy Manager (Manual Configuration) below.</li>
  <li>In your PingFederate account, set up the platform as a Service Provider. See To set up the platform as a Service Provider using PingFederate as the Identity Provider on page 47.</li>
  <li>In Community Manager, complete the setup by following the applicable procedure, depending on how you will be using the SAML domain:
    <ul>
      <li>As a login domain: see To enable a SAML login domain in Community Manager on page 18.</li>
      <li>As an OAuth provider domain: see To configure a SAML OAuth Provider domain in Community Manager on page 18.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
  <li>In Community Manager, test to make sure your domain that uses the SAML Web Browser SSO feature works correctly:
    <ul>
      <li>As a login domain: see Testing the SAML Domain as a Login Domain on page 19.</li>
      <li>As an OAuth provider domain: see Testing the SAML Domain as an OAuth Provider Domain on page 19.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h5>To set up PingFederate as an Identity Provider in Policy Manager (Manual Configuration)</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Log in to the Policy Manager Console.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Configure</strong> tab, click <strong>Security</strong>, and then click <strong>Identity Systems</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add Identity System</strong> to access the Add Identity System wizard.</li>
  <li>In the first page of the wizard, for identity system type, choose <strong>SAML Web Browser SSO</strong>. Provide name and description, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the second page of the wizard, <strong>Select SAML Identity Provider Configuration Method</strong>, choose to configure manually.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to access the <strong>SAML Identity Provider Configuration</strong> page, as shown below.
    <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/pm_wizard_pf_03_ipconfig.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 27}}</p>
  </li>
  <li>Enter the following values:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IdP Entity ID</strong>: Make sure the unique Entity ID for the Identity Provider matches with the value in PingFederate &gt; Server Settings &gt; Federation Info &gt; SAML 2.0 Entity ID. For example, idp.ping.com.</li>
      <li><strong>X.509 Certificate for Signature Verification</strong>: The certificate that the IdP will use to sign the SAML response. Make sure it matches with the value in <strong>PingFederate</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Digital Signing &amp; XML Decryption Keys &amp; Certificates</strong>. You can use an existing certificate in PingFederate or create a new one, export it, and then upload it to Policy Manager.</li>
      <li><strong>Verify Identity Provider Certificate issuer is trusted</strong>: If the issuer is PingFederate, the issuer and subject are the same, so this is not needed; but if the certificate is issued by a CA, it's best to check this box. You would also need to set up the CA as a trusted key issuer in Policy Manager (Configure &gt; Security &gt; Certificates &gt; Trusted CA Certificates).</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication URLs</strong>: Choose the binding you will be using, either HTTP POST or HTTP Artifact, and put in the applicable URL from your PingFederate account (<strong>Federation Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Protocol Endpoints</strong>, <strong>SSO Service section</strong>). Make sure both values match exactly. For example, let's say the value in your PingFederate setup is /idp/SSO.saml2, and the PingFederate Base URL is https://idp.ping.com:9031 (https://{hostname}:{port}); the URL might be https://idp.ping.com:9031/idp/SSO.saml2.p
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The platform currently does not support HTTP Artifact Binding for SAML Web Browser SSO requests.</p></li>
      <li><strong>Artifact Resolution Service</strong>: Although the platform does not support HTTP Artifact for authentication request messages, it does support this binding for response messages. If you want to use it, you must configure the Artifact Resolution Service (ARS). Make sure the values match your PingFederate setup (Federation Settings &gt; Protocol Endpoints, Artifact Resolution Service field).</li>
      <li><strong>ARS Authentication</strong>: If you are using HTTP Artifact you will need to specify authentication for the Artifact Resolution Service: Basic Authentication, Digital Signature (of the Service Provider), or both.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to access the Service Provider Configuration page as shown below.
  <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/pm_wizard_ssocircle_04_spconfig.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 28}}</p></li>
  <li>Enter the Service Provider configuration values. Note:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entity ID</strong>: A unique ID that you define yourself, to identify your Service Provider in the SAML authentication request messages. When setting up your account with the Identity Provider you must specify the Entity ID, which must be unique within the IdP so that the IdP can identify your Service Provider.</li>
      <li><strong>Base URL</strong>: Used to construct the default Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) endpoint. Must be the container address of the container where the SAML Web Browser SSO feature is initialized (
        {protocol_scheme}://{host}:{port}). For more information, see Base URL on page 56.</li>
      <li><strong>Sign Authn Requests</strong>: Generally, it's best to sign authentication requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication Response</strong>: choose from the two supported bindings.
        Note: If you are using HTTP Artifact, you must configure the Artifact Resolution service (previous page of wizard).</li>
      <li><strong>Metadata Configuration</strong>: Choose whether or not to sign the metadata.</li>
      <li><strong>Name-ID Formats</strong>: select all.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to access the <strong>Manage PKI Keys</strong> page as shown below. Here you will set up the keys you will use to sign your SAML authentication request messages.
  <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/pm_wizard_ssocircle_05_pki.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 29}}</p></li>
  <li>Choose to generate or import keys. If you choose <strong>Generate</strong>, provide values in the <strong>Certificate Details</strong> section. If you choose <strong>Import</strong>, you'll need to choose a key management option and provide keystore details as shown below.
    <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/pm_wizard_ssocircle_05_pki_import.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 30}}</p></li>
  <li>Specify additional key values if needed, and then click <strong>Next</strong> to access the Identity Mapping page.</li>
  <li>Set up appropriate values for your PingFederate account:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User Identifier Location</strong>: Specify whether the user identifier is part of NameID or Attribute. This corresponds to the Identity Mapping setup in PingFederate (first example below).</li>
      <li><strong>Attribute Mapping</strong>: Make sure the values match those set up in your PingFederate account.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Examples are shown below.  </p>
  <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/pm_wizard_pf_06_identitymapping.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 31}}</p>
  <p>{{uptohere image <img src="images/pm_wizard_pf_06_identitymapping_example.jpg" alt="xxx" /> 32}}</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>. The identity system is created in Policy Manager and the Service Provider metadata file is generated.</li>
  <li>View the metadata.xml file in the browser at the following URL:
  <p>{http(s)}://{hostname}:{port}/saml/{sp_domain_name}/metadata</p>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure you get the metadata.xml file for the container that has Community Manager installed (if the domain will be used for Community Manager login) and/or has the OAuth Provider feature installed (if the domain will be used for Community Manager OAuth domain, for resource owner authentication for at  least one OAuth Provider).</p></li>
  <li>Save the metadata.xml file to your local drive so that you can upload it to PingFederate.</li>
</ol>
<h5>To set up the platform as a Service Provider using PingFederate as the Identity Provider</h5>
