    <p>HTTP headers can now be configured as multi-valued in the API descriptor WSDL. This forces a parse of the header value before it is passed to the downstream service in order to send each part as an individual value, normalizing the values and removing unnecessary spaces in certain cases.</p>
    <p>Because this behavior is not always required or desirable, a new connection property <tt>http.multi.valued.headers</tt> allows multi-valued headers to be configured on a service basis rather than globally for the container, thus avoiding the parse operation when it is not required.</p>

<h4>Deprecations: 8.4.23</h4>
<h5><em>JOSE Policy deprecated in 8.4.23; customers should transition to JOSE Policy v2 (Unencoded Payload  Support)</em></h5>
<p>A fix in version 8.4.19, correcting how the subject category  is treated for outbound messages, affects any policies that use outbound  identities, such as the WS-Security Policy and JOSE Policy.</p>
<p>This fix, which corrected an error, might cause a problem in  instances where customers are using the original v1 JOSE Policy with outbound  identities, in existing implementations.</p>
<p>The change is not related to the policies themselves, but to  how the subject category is treated for outbound messages.</p>
<p>Because of the limited functionality offered by the JOSE  Policy, it is deprecated in version 8.4.23. Customers should use the newer JOSE  policy version which was introduced in version 8.4.17: JOSE Policy v2 (Unencoded  Payload Support). Differences between these two policies include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Expanded policy configuration support: the new policy       includes separate pages for configuration of inbound vs outbound messages       for both Provider and Consumer role options.</li>
  <li>Bug fixes:</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>In some instances, such as signature verification        failure, the JOSE Policy returned an HTTP 500 response. In these        scenarios, the new policy now returns HTTP 401 (Unauthorized).</li>
    <li>The HS algorithms (HS256, HS384, and HS512) were not        working correctly in the JOSE Policy.</li>
    <li>Some security subjects configured in the policy        configuration were not used appropriately in some cases.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Increased functionality:</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Support of the Unencoded Payload specification</li>
    <li>Support of PS algorithms (PS256, PS384, and PS512)</li>
    <li>Support of the <strong>crit</strong> headers required by the        Open Banking specification</li>
    <li>JWKS support (when configured for consumer Apps in the        App OAuth Profile)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

The workflow controls whether app developers can promote their own apps, the promotion request must be approved, or app developers cannot request promotion at all.<br/>
        If an app has one or more contracts with APIs that exist in the new environment to which the app is being promoted, the contracts are automatically promoted at the same time, and the app will have the same contracts with the same APIs in the new environment. For detail, see <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/learnmore/app_promotion.htm" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Promoting an App to the Next Environment</a> in the Akana docs.</p>

  <h4>New Features: 8.4.17</h4>
  <h5>New JOSE  Security Policy v2 expands JWS support to include RFC7797 and RFC7515</h5>
  <p>The platform now includes a new policy, JOSE Security Policy  v2, which supports both these standards:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>JSON Web Signature (JWS) Unencoded Payload  Option (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797</a></li>
    <li>JSON Web Signature (JWS), <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515" target="_blank" title="JWS standard">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Features of this new policy include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for either standard JWS or compact JWS  unencoded payload. For an unencoded payload, specify a header parameter name  that includes a JSON Web Signature.</li>
    <li>Support of multiple identities for signing and  encryption, allowing asymmetric cryptography.</li>
    <li>Separate pages for configuration of IN options  and OUT/FAULT options.</li>
    <li>Support of additional signature/MAC algorithms  for signing of content in OUT messages, including PS256, PS384, and PS512.</li>
    <li>For OUT or Fault messages:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for custom headers. For example, use a  custom header to define which JWKS <strong>kid</strong> ((Key ID parameter) parameters to use.</li>
      <li>Support for private headers that comply with the  Open Banking 2.0 specification, including specifying custom <strong>iat</strong> and <strong>iss</strong> headers in the <strong>crit</strong> header.</li>

  <h5>Lifecycle Coordinator: API implementation  supports validation and post-processing promotion </h5>
  <p>The API Platform  supports the ability to create a &ldquo;client app&rdquo; representation of an API, used to  establish contact with other APIs. This app is automatically generated if set,  and includes metadata properties identifying the related API or app. The  generated client app also validates to ensure that all contract dependencies to  virtual services exist in the target tenant. <br>

  <h5>Lifecycle Coordinator: set or clear preserve  keys on a tenant-by-tenant basis </h5>
  <p>For multiple early-stage  tenants on a single API Platform installation, preserve keys can be disabled  for promotion between these stages and enabled for remaining downstream stages.<br>
    In previous releases, it  was necessary to choose whether unique Ids would be preserved during promotion  at a Lifecycle Coordinator installation level. This prevented the possibility  of hybrid topologies with a mix of remote and co-located tenants. The key  preservation behavior is now set automatically, based on the relative location  of source and target tenants for a promotion. With this change, the setting of  the preserve-keys configuration flag is no longer necessary.<br>

  <h5>Lifecycle Coordinator: new support of  Runtime Configuration</h5>
  <p>The Runtime  Configuration functionality, previously available only in Lifecycle Manager, is  now available in Lifecycle Coordinator. This allows templates for API  implementation properties to be established and selectively applied based on  custom property filters.<br>
    Runtime configuration  is accomplished through customization of the Lifecycle Manager library in which  custom properties for a tenant are configured. This configuration requires a  working knowledge of the Lifecycle Manager application and the Configuration  Designer Tool.<br>
    For more information,  see <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/promotion/promotion_users_guide.htm#runtime_config" target="_blank">http://docs.akana.com/cm/promotion/promotion_users_guide.htm#runtime_config</a> (Promotion Guide).<br>

  </p>
  <h5>Lifecycle Coordinator: provide control to  set Approval Required flag on API</h5>
  <p>With the addition of the  Runtime Configuration feature, Lifecycle Coordinator now supports control of  the Approval Required flag on an API. This can be used, for example, to support  a scenario in which an API will be exposed to different groups of consumers: for  example, internal consumers who should be able to create a contract automatically,  and external consumers whose requests should be approved by the API Admin.<br>
    This classifier is  applicable only when the <strong>Allow Anonymous  Access</strong> flag is set to <strong>False</strong>.  Leaving this classifier unset indicates that the <strong>Approval Required</strong> value of the implementation should not be  modified.<br>

  <h5>External OAuth Provider Domain: with PingFederate  provider, support for syncing app certificate with PingFederate</h5>
  <p>For the PingFederate provider, the developer portal&rsquo;s External  OAuth Provider domain setup now supports an additional property <strong>Synchronize Client Certificate</strong>,  available on the Extensions page. If checked, apps that have a contract with an  API using this domain can authenticate with PingFederate via the app&rsquo;s  certificate.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-17877</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>External OAuth Provider Domain now includes a &ldquo;refresh_token&rdquo; grant type  option in the default list of options </h5>
  <p>In the developer  portal&rsquo;s External OAuth Provider domain setup, Provider page, the Supported  Grant Types field now includes an additional option, Refresh Token. The new  option supports external OAuth providers that list refresh token as a separate  grant type. The new option appears on the list of default grant types only if  the user selects manual configuration or if the provider&rsquo;s well-known  configuration includes it. If any domain on the platform includes this option,  it appears on the default list of grant types in the App OAuth Profile page.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This option doesn&rsquo;t appear in domains that were created  before upgrading to 8.4.17. To make sure the new option is enabled in the App  OAuth Profile page, you can create a new domain and select the Refresh Token  option. It will then appear in the App OAuth Profile page, and will work for  pre-existing domains even though the setting doesn&rsquo;t appear in the user  interface for those domains. Using this approach means you don&rsquo;t need to  re-create existing domains.</p>

  <h5>Lifecycle Coordinator: support for  automatically promoting APIs across environments based on custom property state</h5>
  <p>A new task &ldquo;Promote API  to next Environment&rdquo; is now available when customizing the API workflow  behavior using the Lifecycle Manager Extensions feature. This task can be used  to trigger auto-promotion of an API based on the current state of the API&rsquo;s  custom properties.<br>

  <p>For  security policies configured with a specific algorithm suite, the default  behavior of the policy enforcement handlers is to allow sending requests that  use a different algorithm suite without returning an error. In order to support  validation of algorithms while retaining backwards compatibility, a new  configuration property, <strong>com.soa.wssecurity</strong> -&gt; <strong>validate.algorithms</strong>, has been  introduced. By default, this is set to <strong>false</strong>.  When <strong>true</strong>, the WS-Security policy  handler validates that the algorithms used for signatures and encryption match  the configured algorithm suite.<br>

  <h3>Version 8.4.16</h3>
  <h4>Minor Enhancements:  8.4.16</h4>
  <h5>Lifecycle Coordinator: Policy Mappings for  API Promotion</h5>
  <p>In Lifecycle  Coordinator, the Promotion Profile can now include a set of policy mappings to  tailor the propagation and validation of policy references when an API is  promoted to the target environment.<br>
    For example, use the  PolicyMapping element to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Map a policy reference in the source environment  to a policy in the target environment.</li>
    <li>Remove a policy reference altogether when an API  is promoted.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Further, a new policy  mapping property <strong>original-tenant-name</strong><strong></strong> can be added to the tenant definition  to indicate the original name. This prevents unmapped validation errors when  promoting an API, in the event that the tenant name has been changed in the  site settings. For example:</p>
  <pre class="code">{ 

  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;devtenant&quot;, 

  &quot;name&quot;:  &quot;DevelopmentTenant&quot;, 

  &quot;address&quot;:  &quot;http://devacmepaymentscorptenant:9457&quot;, 

  &quot;properties&quot;: [

  <h5>Role Security does  not line up with abilities within developer portal</h5>
  <p>When a new role was created in the developer portal that gave  full access permissions for contracts, and that role was then assigned to a  user, the user was still unable to cancel, reactivate, or suspend a contract. Policy  Manager role definitions have been expanded to include Contract as well as App  and API. The Policy Manager user can now define a role that includes full  control for contracts. A user with this role can cancel, reactivate, or suspend  a contract. In the developer portal, the Business Admin can then assign this  role to the user. <br>
    Note that the role must be implemented in a custom API Contract  workflow for this feature to work. <br>
    For example, consider a role &ldquo;ContractExecutive&rdquo; added in Policy  Manager. To give a user assigned to this role the ability to suspend a  contract, add the condition <strong>authorizeByAtmosphereRole</strong> to the API Contract workflow in the sections where the contract status and the suspend  action apply:</p>
  <pre class="code">&lt;action id=&quot;600&quot; name=&quot;apicontract.action.suspend&quot;&gt;

  &lt;restrict-to&gt;

    &lt;conditions  type=&quot;OR&quot;&gt;

  <h4>Minor Enhancements: 8.4.15</h4>
  <h5>Dashboard  page: Bulk deletion of notifications</h5>
  <p>Previously, Dashboard notifications could only be deleted  individually. However, in some scenarios, one user might have a large number of  notifications. The new feature allows users to delete many notifications at  once. It includes two new checkboxes at the top of the page: <strong>Delete Checked</strong> and <strong>Delete All on Page</strong>.<br>
    The Dashboard page uses infinite scrolling rather than paging, so  a user who has many notifications only needs to scroll down to load additional  notifications (20 at a time).<br>
    Each notification has a checkbox. The user can use any of  these approaches:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Check one or more individual notifications and  then click <strong>Delete Checked</strong>.</li>
    <li>Check <strong>Check  All on Page</strong> and then click <strong>Delete  Checked</strong>.</li>
    <li>Scroll down to retrieve additional  notifications, then check and delete them as above.</li>

  <h5>Test Client: New check box gives user control over URL  encoding</h5>
  <p>By default, Test Client  applies URL encoding to any special characters in the request URL. However, in  some cases the user might not want URL encoding to apply.<br>
    For flexibility, Test  Client now includes a check box, directly below the URL field, titled <strong>Encode URL</strong>.<br>
    The new check box is  checked by default, to control URL-encoding of the URL. Users who don&rsquo;t want  URL encoding can just clear the check box.<br>

    The platform has now been enhanced to automatically retrieve any  updates to this information, from the identity provider, at user login. If the  information has changed, the user&rsquo;s profile is automatically updated.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-16890</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>New configuration options for new account  evaluation period</h5>
  <p>If the Site Admin adds a  user in the developer portal, the new account is disabled after a specified  time period if the user never logs in. The time period is determined by the  Site Admin in the user settings (<strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Users</strong>).<br>
    The previous maximum was  30 days. These choices have been expanded for greater flexibility. The choices  are now: any single digit 1â€“30; 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, or 180. You can also  choose <strong>Never Expire</strong>.<br>

  <h5>Workflow for Users: New ability to bypass  the Accept Agreement checkbox on Activation page/process for specific users</h5>
  <p>By default, the platform  required acceptance of the platform legal agreement, if one is uploaded to the  developer portal.<br>
    The platform now  supports the capability to customize the user workflow so that users belonging  to a specific login domain, or users with a specific role, can skip the  mandatory acceptance of the developer portal legal agreement.<br>
    The new feature includes  a new workflow function, <strong>acceptAgreementForDomainUsers</strong>.<br>
    If this custom workflow  feature is in place, new users who match the specified condition do not see the  developer agreement. For these users, the login process just skips that step.<br>
    In the example below,  this function is added in the workflow document, in the &quot;@Login&quot; section,  to skip requiring acceptance of the developer portal agreement for users of the <strong>acmepaymentscorp</strong> domain. This  argument also supports multiple domains with comma separator.</p>
  <pre class="code">&lt;function  type=&quot;acceptAgreementForDomainUsers&quot;&gt;

  &lt;arg name=&quot;DomainName&quot;&gt;acmepaymentscorp&lt;/arg&gt;

&lt;/function&gt; </pre>
  <p>In the example below,  this function is added in the workflow document, in the &quot;@Login&quot;  section, to skip requiring acceptance of the developer portal agreement for  users who have either the Business Administrator or API Developer roles. This  argument supports multiple roles with comma separator, as shown below.</p>
  <pre class="code">&lt;function  type=&quot;acceptAgreementForUsersBelongToRoles&quot;&gt;

  &lt;arg name=&quot;role&quot;&gt;Business  Administrator,API Developer&lt;/arg&gt;

&lt;/function&gt; </pre>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: To see where these fit into the workflow document, you can  download the user workflow from the developer portal. The new function is in  the default workflow, but is commented out.<br>

  <h5 id="SUP-17304">Workflow for Users: New ability to make phone  number optional for specific users</h5>
  <p>By default, new user  signup requires phone number.<br>
    The platform now  supports the capability to customize the user workflow so that users belonging  to a specific login domain are not required to provide a telephone number. If  this functionality is in place, and the condition is met, the phone number is  not shown.<br>
    The new feature  includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A new user workflow initial action, @<strong>UserPhoneNotRequired</strong>.</li>
    <li>A new user workflow condition, <strong>doesUserBelongToDomain</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If this custom workflow  feature is in place, users who belong to the specified domain are not required  to provide telephone number. Instead, the field is not shown.<br>
    This argument also  supports multiple domains with comma separator.<br>
    The example below  shows the new initial action and the new condition. If the user belongs to the  specified domain, the condition is met, and the phone number field is not  shown.</p>
  <pre class="code">&lt;action  id=&quot;25&quot; name=&quot;@UserPhoneNotRequired&quot;&gt;

  &lt;restrict-to&gt;Â Â Â Â Â  

    &lt;conditions type=&quot;AND&quot;&gt;

      &lt;condition type=&quot;doesUserBelongToDomain&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/results&gt;

&lt;/action&gt; </pre>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: To see where these fit into the workflow document, you can  download the user workflow from the developer portal. The new initial action  and condition are in the default workflow, but commented out.<br>

  <h5>Lifecycle Coordinator: Support for API OAuth  Details Configuration</h5>
  <p>Lifecycle Coordinator  functionality includes a new rule that changes the name of the OAuth provider  for a promoted API in the target environment. This allows mapping for the OAuth  Provider.<br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: The new rule is only for use in scenarios where the  configuration of the source and target OAuth Providers is identical, including  scope definition. If the configuration is not identical, using this rule might  cause promotion errors.<br>
    The example below  changes the OAuth Provider name from <strong>SourceProvider</strong> to <strong>TargetProvider</strong>.</p>
  <pre class="code">{    

  &quot;scope&quot; : &quot;vs&quot;,

  <h5>Akana Administration Console: security  improvement re potential username enumeration</h5>
  <p>The Akana Administration  Console login page was returning different messages depending on whether the  username was valid and the password was invalid, or the username itself was  invalid. Returning different results could facilitate username discovery by a  malicious source.<br>

  <h4>Bug fixes: 8.4.15</h4>
  <h5>OAuth: Refresh token always generated</h5>

  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-17148</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>Swagger: Optional Boolean parameters not  recognized</h5>
  <p>The developer portal&rsquo;s  support of Swagger docs did not include support of optional Boolean parameters.  Values of true and false were the only possible values recognized; because of  this, even when the parameter was optional, the developer portal required a  value.<br>
    A new option, <strong>select</strong>, has been added for both required  and optional Boolean parameters.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-17514</span><br>

  <h5>Incorrect hierarchy of policy availability</h5>
  <p>Policies set up in  Policy Manager at the API Platform Tenants level were showing up as available  for selection for APIs set up within a business organization for a specific  tenant. When selected, these policies were returning the following  authorization error:</p>
  <pre class="code">Unable to view Policy  for key: urn:uuid:da0132a2-05f8-11e8-96ed-f37ef11886ec.

  <h5>Lifecycle Coordinator: CM UI displays  &quot;name&quot; rather than &quot;display-name&quot;</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where Lifecycle  Coordinator was in use, Lifecycle Manager classifiers displayed in the  developer portal user interface were displayed with the <strong>name</strong> value visible to the user, rather than the <strong>display-name</strong> value.<br>
    This has been fixed so  that if a value is provided for <strong>display-name</strong>,  that value is used. If no value is provided, the <strong>name</strong> value is used.<br>

  <p class="supID-from-word">SUP-17540</p>
  <h5>Lifecycle  Coordinator: Promotion not honoring vsep.path rule</h5>

  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-17538</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>Lifecycle  Coordinator: during promotion, only the first listener for a deployment zone is  preserved</h5>
  <p>In the SaaS environment, in a scenario where a container had  multiple listenersâ€”for example, an HTTP listener and an HTTPS listenerâ€”if an  API implementation was deployed to the corresponding deployment zone, two  endpoints should result. However, during promotion of the API, only one of the  endpoints was being promoted to the target environment.<br>

  <h5>For API  created from swagger.json document, error returned when calling the API</h5>
  <p>In a specific scenario where a proxy API was created from an  imported Swagger document with the name swagger.json, calls to the API failed  even though the endpoint was valid. The calls returned the following error:</p>
  <pre class="code">{ &quot;faultcode&quot;: &quot;Server&quot;,  &quot;faultstring&quot;: &quot;Error encountered executing svc_{servicename}. 

Cause: Internal system error&quot; } </pre>
  <p>Creating the proxy API first, and then editing the design by  uploading the Swagger document, worked.<br>
    This has been fixed so that importing from a Swagger document  works as expected.<br>

  <h5>Lifecycle  Coordinator not loading in developer portal</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where Lifecycle Coordinator had been installed and  configured, the UI components were still not loading in the developer portal  user interface.<br>
    The issue was that updates to tenants where the address had  changed were not handled correctly.<br>
    This has now been fixed.<br>

  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-17259</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>After  creating an API, UI details and API description document won&rsquo;t load</h5>
  <p>For certain APIs, in the developer portal user interface, neither  the API Details page nor the API description would load, and the user interface  returned an error. This was because of a bug with the user interface&rsquo;s support  of Swagger specification extensions (<a href="https://swagger.io/specification/#specificationExtensions">https://swagger.io/specification/#specificationExtensions</a>).  This has now been fixed.<br>

  <h3 id="8413">Version 8.4.13</h3>
  <h4>Minor Enhancements: 8.4.13</h4>
  <h5>Lifecycle  Coordinator: Support for Organization for promotion and governance</h5>
  <p>Lifecycle Coordinator now supports Business Organizations in  the developer portal. This means that apps and APIs can now be managed within  the context of their business organizations when Lifecycle Coordinator is in  use. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An API can be promoted from a tenant  organization in one environment to the same tenant organization in the next  environment.</li>
    <li>In Lifecycle Coordinator, promotion governance  can be managed for each business organization.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-17060</span> </p>
  <h5>Developer  Portal: thread pool properties added for Add/Edit Container Listener</h5>
  <p>Previously, thread pool properties for Add/Edit Container  Listener could only be set up in Policy Manager. These settings have now been  added in the developer portal.<br>
    In the context of the developer portal, thread pool settings are  configured for the listener by the Business Admin (<strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>API Gateways</strong> &gt; choose API Gateway &gt; <strong>Inbound  Listeners</strong> section, <strong>Edit</strong> button  &gt; choose listener &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>).<br>
  </p>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-22115</p>
  <h5>Users can  now add and edit identities for the API implementation</h5>
  <p>Authorized users can now add and edit identities for an API  implementation. Previously, this activity could only be completed in Policy  Manager.<br>
    To edit an identity: <strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Implementation</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> button.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-22418 + ATMO-21137 for 8.4.13 / ATMO-20455 for 8.5</span></p>
  <h4>Bug fixes: 8.4.13</h4>
  <h5>When QoS throughput policy is exceeded, app name displayed  as &quot;undefined&quot; in API transaction logs</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where the QoS throughput policy was exceeded, the  app name was displayed as &quot;undefined&quot; in API transaction logs, with a  &ldquo;Quota Exceeded&rdquo; error message.<br>
    Now, if the quota is exceeded, &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; is displayed in the app  column. When the quota is exceeded, the contract isn&rsquo;t used and the transaction  is rejected, therefore the app name isn&rsquo;t displayed even though the <strong>atmosphere_app_id</strong> was passed.<br>
    In this scenario, the same transaction will not show up in the  app logs, since the contract was not used.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">MUT-354329</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>Swagger support: API Designer UI improvement for path  parameters</h5>
  <p>Per the Swagger  definition, path parameters are always required; therefore, default values are  ignored. These rules were not apparent in the API Designer user interface; the  API Designer allowed path parameters to be set as optional, and default values  to be specified, but this information was not saved or, if saved, was not  implemented.<br>
    Now, the API Designer UI  has been modified to clarify the rules for users. In the Add and Edit views,  for a path parameter, the <strong>Required</strong> checkbox is displayed as checked but is disabled so that users cannot change  this setting. In the summary view, no default value is displayed.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-17190</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>Vulnerable  XSLT library allowed code execution through XSLT extended functions</h5>
  <p>A new platform configuration setting was added to increase security  by preventing XSLT transformation. This helps protect against malicious  attacks.<br>
    Now, by default, XSLT transformation is not allowed. If  necessary, customers can enable the setting, but this is not recommended.<br>
    The new setting is in the Akana Administration Console for the  container:<br>
    <strong>Configuration Categories</strong> &gt; <strong>com.soa.framework.xsl.transform</strong> category &gt; <strong>java.extension.enabled</strong> field.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-17013</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>In some  cases, after uploading a certificate, developer portal not showing a list of  aliases to pick from</h5>
  <p>In the developer portal, when a user uploads a certificate,  the user interface should read the aliases from the certificate and display a  list of available aliases, from which the user can pick one. This was not  working in these two places in the UI, and has now been fixed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>API Implementation</strong> when  uploading a certificate for the implementation.</li>
    <li><strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>API Gateway</strong> when uploading a  certificate for the API Gateway.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-16691</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>In OAuth  grant requests, query parameters decoded twice</h5>
  <p>In a specific scenario where OAuth Resource Owner (password)  grant requests were in use, and the resource owner username included a plus  sign (+), the plus sign was represented as a space in the Subject claim of the  JWT access token, due to an encoding/decoding error.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-16539</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>API  interface: issue with GET /api/users/{userID}/apis</h5>
  <p>This API operation returns the APIs for the specified user, and  can be run by that user or by a Site Admin. However, when a Site Admin called  the operation, APIs for the Site Admin were returned as well as APIs for the  specified user.<br>
    This has been fixed so that only the APIs for the specified user,  per the UserID in the URL, are returned.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-16381</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>Policy  Manager: Service Level Policy, limitation re time period ending at midnight</h5>
  <p>In Policy Manager, when defining an action on a Service Level  Policy, it was not possible to set a time period that ended with midnight  (00:00); the user interface didn&rsquo;t allow it. This has been fixed so that  midnight can be entered as 24:00.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-17083</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>Improved UI  messaging on API Access wizard</h5>
  <p>In the first tab of the API Access wizard, the user chooses an  app, and then goes on to make other selections in subsequent tabs of the  wizard. It&rsquo;s possible to click through to other tabs and try to complete the  wizard without choosing an app, in which case, on save, the first tab title is  displayed in red to indicate an issue.<br>
    In the past, in the actual tab, there was no messaging to tell  the user that this issue was that an app had not been not selected. Now,  messaging has been added to better direct the user.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10250</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>Swagger API:  for Delete operation, message processing not as expected</h5>
  <p>When an API was defined by importing a Swagger API Description  document, with a Delete operation defined with a success response of 204, the  platform was building the process without a Reply Node. This resulted in the  behavior being asynchronous, and the operation not working.<br>
    In another scenario, a 400 error response was defined for a  Delete operation, but the platform did not correctly relay the response body.<br>
    <span class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: this issue was  actually fixed in version 8.4.10, but was not included in the 8.4.10 release  notes.</span><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-16471, SUP-16553</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>Issue with  search feature for developer portal content causing problems with search  results</h5>
  <p>Within the developer portal, the Search feature indexes the  uploaded content and other pages and returns search results from this content.<br>
    There were several issues with the Search feature, caused by the  way it constructed the URL and resulting in problems with search results for  documents uploaded to different sections of the /content folder structure. In  some cases, content pages were not included in search results; in other cases,  they did appear in the search results, but when the user clicked the link, the  content was not displayed correctly due to the way the platform constructed the  URL.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11020</span><br class="supID-from-word">
  </p>
  <h5>Ability to  set API outbound identity in the developer portal</h5>
  <p>Previously, the API outbound identity could only be set up in  Policy Manager.<br>
    From within the Process Editor in the developer portal, in the <strong>Invoke</strong> activity, an attempt to define  the identity resulted in the following error message:</p>
  <pre class="code">Identity not found. </pre>
  <p>This functionality has now been added in the developer portal so  that these settings can be defined or changed in either Policy Manager or  Community Manager and the settings are in sync.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-15806 / SUP-17187</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>New security  setting to help prevent content injection</h5>
  <p>In the developer portal, it&rsquo;s possible to reference an  external website within an &lt;iframe&gt; tag in a content page, using the <strong>&amp;doc</strong> parameter:</p>
  <pre class="code">{protocol}://{hostname}/{tenant}/#!{sitepage}&amp;doc={URL-encoded  external URL} </pre>
  <p>The example below illustrates how this might look using the  Simple Developer theme&rsquo;s documentation page, and referencing the external  website <strong>http://www.example.com</strong>:</p>
  <pre class="code">http://acmepaymentscorp.com/acmepaymentscorp/#!documentation&amp;doc=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com </pre>
  <p>However, this feature could be an insecurity, since the external  site to be displayed could potentially be modified via a malicious content  injection. For Site Admins who want to disable the ability to reference  external sites on a developer portal content page, there is a new setting in <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong>.  The new setting is <strong>Allow display of  external content in developer portal content pages</strong>. By default, for  security purposes, this setting is disabled.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-17113</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>Developer  Portal, Challenge Constraints: UI does not validate that minimum character  value cannot be greater than maximum</h5>
  <p>The developer portal includes a page for the Site Admin to  specify values associated with security challenge constraints (<strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Challenges</strong>).<br>
    The page where constraints are set for new or existing security  challenge question includes minimum and maximum values. This page was not  validating that the minimum character value was lower than the maximum  character value. This has been fixed.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-16562</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>Server Side Request Forgery prevention: new restriction to  limit protocols to HTTP and HTTPS</h5>
  <p>As an added security  measure, a check was added in the forward proxy URL handler that will throw an exception  if the scheme (protocol) for the URL is anything other than HTTP or HTTPS.<br>
  </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-17012</span><br>
  </p>
  <h5>Internet Explorer 11: Error when viewing API Analytics  &gt; Logs</h5>
  <p>When viewed in Internet  Explorer version 11, the Developer Portal&rsquo;s API <strong>Analytics</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong> page  returned an HTTP 400 error (Bad Request). There was no issue with other  browsers. This has been fixed.<br>

  <h5 id="SUP-16698">SOAP to POX  transformation not working after upgrade to 8.2.12</h5>
  <p>In a specific scenario, after upgrade from version 6.x to version  8.2.12, SOAP to POX transformation was no longer working. The Network Director  returned an HTTP 500 error with the message:</p>
  <pre class="code">Changing the version of a SOAP message in this manner is  disallowed. </pre>

  <h4>Minor Enhancements: 8.4.12</h4>
  <h5>Lifecycle  Integration: New expandable section for optional properties on user  invite/signup page</h5>
  <p>In the past, when Lifecycle Manager integration was enabled (<strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Site</strong>), optional fields from Lifecycle Integration were not  displayed in the user signup page and invite pages; instead, they were only  displayed in the user&rsquo;s <strong>Profile</strong> page. Now, the optional properties on the user signup and invite pages are  contained in a collapsible region on those pages, in addition to being  displayed on the <strong>Profile</strong> page.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-22164</p>
  <h5>Enhancement  to External OAuth Provider Configuration</h5>
  <p>The External OAuth Provider domain now sends the <strong>state</strong> and <strong>nonce</strong> parameters in the Authorization URL when the Provider Type is <strong>Other</strong>.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-16446</p>
  <h5>Lifecycle Integration:  New ability to specify target deployment zone information when promoting APIs</h5>
  <p>Lifecycle Coordinator users can now control deployment of an API  to one or more specific deployment zones based on deployment zone mapping  information within the topology definition. Target deployment zones can  optionally be selected based on custom properties of the API that&rsquo;s being  promoted.<br>
    In the previous version, the exported form of an API included  information about the listener and container for each endpoint of the API. It  was then necessary to map this information to the appropriate containers and  listeners in the target environment using rules in the topology definition.  This didn&rsquo;t work well if the endpoints in the source environment didn&rsquo;t map  smoothly to those in the target environment.<br>
    Now, the user has more flexibility to map deployment zones  in the target environment. For details of the functionality, refer to the updated Promotion  Guide: <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/promotion/promotion_users_guide.htm#dz_configurations">http://docs.akana.com/cm/promotion/promotion_users_guide.htm#dz_configurations</a>. <br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-17061</p>
  <h5>New  configuration property to allow configuration of HTTP context selection  &quot;strictness&quot;</h5>
  <p>A new configuration property was added, for enhanced platform  security.<br>
    The property is:</p>
  <pre class="code">com.soa.platform.jetty -&gt; context.manager.strict </pre>
  <p>The new property defaults to <strong>false</strong>,  which is the legacy behavior.<br>
    When the property is <strong>false</strong>,  if a request is not matched in any given HTTP context, the next best matching  context is tried. If the property is set to <strong>true</strong>, only the best matching context is tried. If that doesn&rsquo;t  work, the request fails.<br>

  <h4>Bug fixes: 8.4.12</h4>
  <h5>External  OAuth Provider not working with client credentials</h5>
  <p>The OAuth Provider Domain setup (<strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Domains</strong> &gt; <strong>Add Domain</strong> or <strong>Modify Domain</strong>) was not allowing the choice of only the Client  Credentials grant type (Tab 3). The domain would not save, and the following  error was returned:</p>
  <pre class="code">Invalid security domain configuration. Grant type not available </pre>
  <p>When another grant type was selected as well as Client  Credentials, the domain configuration could be saved. </p>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-16787 </span> </p>
  <h5>OAuth Field  Connect verifier page returns HTTP 500 with debugging information</h5>
  <p>The OAuth verifier page (oauth/auz/authorize) page was returning  an HTTP 500 error with debugging information. Now, the platform does not throw  an exception, but returns an HTML document with the error description.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-11093</p>
  <h5>Backend support for Swagger UI patch</h5>
  <p>Support was added for a Swagger patch, to support the ability to define  responses in the <strong>/responses</strong> element  of the Swagger document and to reference them from individual resources with  the <strong>#/responses</strong> reference.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-13839</p>
  <h5>Groups  functionality visible in developer portal when group support is disabled</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where support of groups was disabled in the  developer portal (<strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Groups</strong> &gt; <strong>Group Support</strong>),  group functionality was still visible in the user interface. For example, users  could see the <strong>Add Group</strong> menu item.  However, if the user attempted to add a group, the developer portal returned an  error.<br>
    This has been fixed so that if this functionality is disabled the  UI option is not visible to the user.<br>

  <h5>Lifecycle  Integration: Alpaca transform for more than two levels of compound classifier  declarations</h5>
  <p>Lifecycle Manager compound classifier taxonomy declarations  deeper than two levels were resulting in an invalid JSON document after the  Alpaca transform. Lifecycle Integration now supports a taxonomy three levels deep.<br>

  <p class="supID">SUP-17018</p>
  <h5>Lifecycle  Coordinator: Remote Tenants missing Console Address information</h5>
  <p>When creating a topology with remote tenants, the console address  was null in the topology library. Without modification, this would result in  the links to promoted APIs not rendering correctly for the remote tenants.<br>

  <h5>LDAP  security provider scheduled job running constantly</h5>
  <p>The LDAP security provider uses a scheduled job to evict  connections from the connection pool. When the job repeat interval was set, the  refresh interval was being treated as a seconds value, causing the job to run much  more frequently than expected. This was causing performance problems and  consuming unnecessary CPU bandwidth.<br>
    This has been modified to use a single scheduled job for all LDAP  domains, and there is now a configuration setting to control the eviction interval.  The new properties are in the <strong>com.soa.security.provider.ldap</strong> PID.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-16957</p>
  <h5>Lifecycle Integration: Null option needed for specific  extensible properties</h5>
  <p>When a classifier was  defined in Lifecycle Manager, with no default set in the capture template, it  defaulted to <strong>TRUE</strong> in the developer  portal for extensible properties of these types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Optional Boolean</li>
    <li>Optional Enum</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The developer portal  didn&rsquo;t support a null value for these properties, but it now does. Now, for  optional fields of these types, the developer portal shows a value of <strong>Select</strong> to prompt the user to choose a  value.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-17019</p>
  <h5 id="SUP-16410">Edit Design does not load</h5>
  <p>In a specific scenario, when an API was created in the developer  portal from an imported Swagger document, the API Designer page did not load.<br>
    This was because the Swagger included cyclic references within  it, that caused recursion, which the API Designer was unable to resolve.<br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: The way that the  developer portal treats cyclic references was modified in an earlier fix for  version 8.4.1 (see <a href="#SUP-15133">Add API from Swagger document: objects of type Entity do not expand  correctly</a>, SUP-15133, SUP-13752).  Fixing the current issue causes the earlier issue to resurface.<br>

  <h5>Additional JMS properties added to container properties  documentation</h5>
  <p>The following additional properties  were added to the <strong>com.soa.jms</strong> properties documentation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>jms.session.manager.maxIdleTime</strong>:  Allows configuration of the maximum idle time for the session pools.</li>
    <li><strong>jms.session.manager.maxSessionPoolSize</strong>:  Allows configuration of the maximum size of the session pool.</li>

  <h5>API and app  field validation errors</h5>
  <p>The following field validation errors were fixed for apps and  APIs in the developer portal:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>API description was limited to one character  less than the 4000 characters allowed by the database.</li>
    <li>API summary was limited to one character less  than the 255 characters allowed by the database.</li>
    <li>App Markdown field returned a general system  error instead of validating for the 4000-character length.</li>

  <h5>Policy  Manager Contract Management API: Corrected example in generated doc</h5>
  <p>In the generated doc for the Policy  Manager Contract Management API (ContractAdminService), the documentation for  the <strong>GET&nbsp;/rest/contracts</strong> operation  included a sample response in application/json, but the API returns only  application/xml. When an application/json Accept header was used, the operation  returned HTTP 404 (Not Found).<br>
    The generated  documentation has been updated, since this operation does not in fact return  application/json, only application/xml.<br>

  <h4>Known issue: 8.4.12</h4>
  <h5>When  creating or updating API from a specific Swagger document, objects of type  Entity do not expand correctly</h5>
  <p>A fix was made in version 8.4.1 to ensure that when creating or  updating an API from a specific Swagger document, if there were multiple  objects of the same type, all objects would expand (see <a href="#SUP-15133">Add API from Swagger document: objects of type Entity do not expand  correctly</a>, SUP-15133, SUP-13752).  Prior to that point, only the first object of the same type would expand. <br>
    However, that fix introduced an issue that if the Swagger  document included cyclic references, the API Designer could not load the  Swagger at all, as it was unable to resolve the cyclic references.<br>
    The second issue was fixed in version 8.4.12â€”see <a href="#SUP-16410">Edit Design does not load</a>.  However, this fix causes a regression of the first issue.<br>

  <h4>Minor Enhancements: 8.4.11</h4>
  <h5>Support of  CAPTCHA in site signup and Forgot Password pages</h5>
  <p>Version 8.4.11 includes support for adding a CAPTCHA to certain  pages in the developer portal. Using a CAPTCHA helps ensure that the entity  performing the action is a human, not a bot.<br>
    The feature supports Google reCAPTCHA, reCAPTCHA v2, for  validation of users by means of the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a robot&rdquo; checkbox, which presents  users with visual challenges they must answer correctly as part of entering  information on those pages.<br>
    <span class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This feature  does not support invisible reCAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA Android.</span>When enabled, CAPTCHA is displayed in the following pages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>New user <strong>Sign  Up</strong> page (via <strong>Create Account</strong> link)</li>
    <li><strong>Forgot  Password</strong> page</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The feature includes the following new settings, in the <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> settings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CAPTCHA  Support</strong> (enabled/disabled). If CAPTCHA Support is enabled:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CAPTCHA  Site Key</strong>: take this from your reCAPTCHA account, <strong>sitekey</strong> value.</li>
      <li><strong>CAPTCHA  Secret Key</strong>: take this from your reCAPTCHA account, <strong>secret</strong> value.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Once the Secret  value is saved, it isn&rsquo;t displayed in the developer portal user interface. In  addition, the developer portal API doesn&rsquo;t return the Secret value. It&rsquo;s  encrypted and stored securely in the database.<br>
    Once the Google reCAPTCHA account is set up with the domain value  for the developer portal (for example, acmepaymentscorp.com), and the developer  portal setting is enabled and set up with the CAPTCHA values, users signing up  or clicking <strong>Forgot Password</strong> will be  presented with a CAPTCHA challenge which they must pass as part of entering  information on those pages.<br>

  <h5>API  interface enhancement: new operation for adding an app returns Application  model object</h5>
  <p>In the API platform, the existing operation for adding an app  automatically creates the first app version. It returns the AppID but not the  AppVersionID.<br>
    Now, a new operation has been introduced that returns the full  Application model object, including the AppID and AppVersionID.<br>
    The new operation is similar to the existing operation (see <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/api/apps/m_apps_addApp.htm">http://docs.akana.com/cm/api/apps/m_apps_addApp.htm</a>),  but uses different headers:</p>

  <h4>Bug fixes: 8.4.11</h4>
  <h5>File Manager  error</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where the Site Admin went to <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Resources</strong>,  opened the File Manager, and navigated to the API documentation folder  (content/api), the File Manager displayed the following error message:</p>
  <pre class="code">Error retrieving data. data= ; textStatus= error; errorThrown=  Server Error </pre>
  <p><span class="supID-from-word">SUP-15474, SUP-16500</span><br>

  <h5>Network  Director: DoS rules fail when an IPv6 address is passed in X-Forwarded-For  header</h5>

  <h5>Swagger 2.0:  Support of example values for parameters on endpoints</h5>
  <p>The platform now supports example values for parameters in  Swagger 2.0. If an example is provided in the imported JSON Swagger document,  it is displayed in the <strong>Schema</strong> column  on these pages/sections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Details</strong></li>

  <h5>In API  Designer, if query parameter is mandatory, cannot specify default value</h5>
  <p>In API Designer, users can specify a default value for query  parameters. However, if the query parameter was made mandatory, the option to  specify a default value was no longer available. This was fixed. In addition,  the user interface was modified to display the default value, if one was  specified, below the input field, in this format:</p>
  <pre class="code">default: xxxx </pre>
  <p>Note that in Test Client/Swagger Test Client, the input field is  not populated with the default value.<br>

  <h5>Developer  portal logs use incorrect time zone with Custom option</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where the identity system was Directory Server,  after logging in and accessing <strong>Monitor</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong> for an app or API, the  logs were using a specific time zone, America/Los Angeles, regardless of the  time zone set in the account. Even when a different time zone was set for local  domain users, the logs were using the America/Los Angeles time zone. This is  because the developer portal was using the TimeZone query parameter in the data  request.<br>
    Now, when the user is specifying a date range in the monitoring  logs, if the customer chooses the Custom option, the TimeZone query parameter  is not used for the data set. Custom time zone is specified in UTC time as it  should be.<br>

  <h5 id="ATMO-21714">New setting for unique combination of virtual host and  context path</h5>
  <p>In version 8.0, it was possible to publish multiple APIs with the  same context path; for example, to have just a backslash (/) as the context  path.<br>
    However, in a later version, a validation check for unique  combination of virtual host and context path was added. In some cases, this  caused the API path to be automatically modified so that it was unique. Some  instances that had multiple APIs with a backslash as the context path were  affected by this.<br>
    Version 8.4.11 includes a new API setting, <strong>Validate that API context path is unique</strong>. By default, this setting  is enabled, so that unique combination of virtual host and context path is  validated. However, the Site Admin can modify the setting so that different  APIs can have the same combination of virtual host and context path. This gives  the tenant the flexibility to keep the validation check for unique path (the  default), or to disable it.<br>

    Now, there is increased support of different formats so that  users can specify a combination of a specific hostname and a wildcard. Support  of wild cards includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>*.example.com</strong>â€”asterisk  used as a wild card with a domain and sub-domain.</li>
    <li><strong>*.apiportal.example.com</strong>â€”asterisk  used as a wild card with domain/sub-domain and prefix.</li>

  <h5>Response for  DELETE operation changes from Default to 200</h5>
  <p>In the developer portal, in the API Designer, when a response  type for an operation was defined as Default, and the operation was then  edited, the response type was changing from Default to 200. As a result, in  some cases the operation did not work as expected.<br>
    Now, Default response is preserved on edit. In addition, in the  developer portal, operations that are set to return a Default response are now  displayed in gray.<br>

  <p>Changes were made to operations in the developer portal&rsquo;s Groups  API service, for information relating to the Tags field in a group definition,  to help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).<br>

In addition, when an email address that included a plus  sign was used in the Client Username as part of the Resource Owner credentials  in an OAuth call, the call was not successful. <br>
    A back-end error has been fixed to correct the OAuth scenario.

  <h5>Import: API  visibility setting is not correct</h5>
  <p>After importing an API into Community Manager, the visibility  setting for the API was not correct; however, the visibility setting for the  API version was correct. The result was that in some cases the API would show  up on search results, but if the user clicked the search result, the user would  get an Unauthorized message. For example, if the API was set to a visibility of  Registered Users, it would show up even if the user who was searching was not  logged in, but the user would not actually be able to view the API.<br>

  <h5>Platform JWT  tokens do not follow RFC 7519 with regard to expiration</h5>
  <p>In some scenarios, JSON Web Tokens (JWT tokens) were expiring  after a short period of time whereas, per the settings, they should be valid  for some days. In addition, where messages were processed by multiple  deployment zones, in some cases there were differences in how different  deployment zones implemented the validity period, resulting in a token being  rejected as expired and then, a little later on, being accepted as valid by  another deployment zone.<br>
    This was because the platform&rsquo;s implementation of JWT tokens was  not validating time correctly, taking into consideration future time and  clockSkew value. The platform was using a default time of 20 minutes as the  default for IAT (issuedAt) claim expiration, rather than calculating the  expected time based on the issuedAt and clockSkew properties.<br>

  <h4>Minor Enhancements: 8.4.7</h4>
  <h5>For request  with incorrect HTTP verb, response is now 405 Method Not Allowed, plus Allow  header</h5>
  <p>Requests to an API endpoint at the correct path, but using an  HTTP method not supported by the endpoint, previously resulted in an HTTP 404  (Not Found) response.<br>
    The behavior on this condition has been changed to return HTTP  405 (Method Not Allowed), accompanied by an Allow header reflecting the  allowable HTTP methods for the endpoint. This is more in line with section  10.4.6 of the HTTP specification. <br>

  <h5>Simple Dev  theme: Export of app log information fails if there are many records</h5>
  <p>In Simple Dev theme, in <strong>Analytics</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong> &gt; <strong>Export</strong>, export of log information failed if there were many  records. With a small number of records, export was successful. This has been  fixed. However, note that the limit for a single download of records in the  developer portal is 10,000. If the criteria used for export might include more  than 10,000 records, use the export capability of the Policy Manager console  instead.<br>

  <h5>Hermosa  theme: When inviting users, fields are not cleared when user clicks Finish</h5>
  <p>In Hermosa theme, users can click the Plus icon to invite a new  user, enter email address and message, and click <strong>Finish</strong>, and an invitation email is sent to the invited user (or  users). However, after an invitation was successful, the information wasn&rsquo;t  being cleared from the fields, and then, if the inviting user clicked <strong>Finish</strong> again, another notification was  sent out. This issue did not appear in Default Theme.<br>
    This has now been fixed so that the fields are cleared if the  user clicks <strong>Finish</strong> and the send is  successful.<br>

  <h5>Corrected wording on 8.4 release notes article re characters  in context page</h5>
  <p>A bug fix, <a href="#SUP-11075">Add API: Adding the context path with an extra space or special  character fails</a>,  was summarized incorrectly in the 8.4 release notes, and carried forward to  release notes for subsequent point releases, up to and including 8.4.6.<br>
    The article stated four validation rules for the context path.  In fact, only two of those rules are accurate. Validation rules for the context  path are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It cannot include spaces.</li>
    <li>Forward slash (/) and hyphen (-) are allowed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The article included these two validation rules which are <strong>not</strong> accurate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It cannot include special characters.</li>
    <li>Question mark (?) is not allowed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Minor Enhancements: 8.4.6</h4>
  <h5>In  Production environment, user accounts are automatically deleted without  notification after 30 days of inactivity</h5>

  <h5>Improve  service search performance in Invoke activity</h5>
  <p>When a user opened an <strong>Invoke</strong> activity in the Process Editor, in a scenario where there were a lot of  services, the page was very slow to open, because it was searching for all services  in order to populate the drop-down list.<br>
    To improve performance, the following changes were made:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When the Invoke page opens, the <strong>Service</strong>/<strong>Interface</strong>/<strong>Operation</strong> fields are populated as before, but the drop-down arrow is disabled.</li>
    <li>If the user wants to select a different service,  the user must click the <strong>Search</strong> button. Users can search for specific text or leave the field blank, in which  case all services are loaded.</li>
    <li>After the search is complete, the Service  drop-down is enabled, and the user can then select from that list. Once the  user selects the service, the operation is enabled and available for selection.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The result is that the <strong>Invoke  Activity</strong> page opens more quickly, but the drop-down lists are disabled  until a search is performed.</p>
  <h5>Increased  security for challenge questions and answers</h5>
  <p>Several changes were implemented to allow the Site Admin to  configure security challenge questions, to control constraints/level of difficulty  and thus, as needed, to increase the security level on this feature.<br>
    Previously, customers could only modify the default security  challenge questions via the developer portal API. In addition, it was not  possible to set constraints on answers.<br>
    Now, the developer portal user interface includes new pages  for adding, managing, and configuring security challenge questions. The new  pages are available to the Site Admin via <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Challenges</strong>:</p>
  <p><img src="img/security-question-settings.png" width="668" height="430" alt=""/></p>
  <p>For each security question, as well as specifying the actual  question, the Site Admin can configure constraints such as minimum and maximum  number of letters, numbers, and special characters allowed or required in the  answers, whether answers are case-sensitive, and whether spaces are allowed.<br>
    The Site Admin can delete questions; however, if any users have  already set up answers to questions that are then deleted, those questions and  answers are still available for account verification purposes.<br>

  <h5>API Test  Client shows all apps for selection but returns Unauthorized error for  unauthorized apps</h5>
  <p>When testing an API in Test Client, the Apps drop-down list was  showing all apps, but then returning an Unauthorized error if the user chose an  app that he/she didn&rsquo;t have permission to use.<br>
    Now, if the user chooses an app for which he/she doesn&rsquo;t have  authorization, Test Client displays the following message:<br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: To use this app in Test  Client, you will need to provide the app&rsquo;s shared secret. Please contact an app  team member.<br>

    This has now been modified to be a quartz job and made to run  every minute. This value can be changed in the database if needed.<br>

  <h5>Cannot  remove group memberships if inviting user has been deleted</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where User A invited User B to be a Site Admin or  Business Admin, User B accepted, and then later User A was removed from the  system, it was not possible to remove User B from the Site Admin or Business  Admin group. The developer portal returned an error, &ldquo;Could not remove member.&rdquo;  This has been fixed.<br>

  <h5>Corrected  wording on 8.4 release notes article re multiple parameters in Test Client  calls</h5>
  <p>An issue with multiple parameters of the same name in Test Client  was summarized incorrectly in the 8.4 release notes, and carried forward to  release notes for subsequent point releases, up to and including 8.4.5.<br>
    The actual issue was that if multiple parameters with the same  name and different values were included in a Test Client call, only the last  value was accepted. The fix was that all instances are now passed through to  the API for processing.<br>
    The article (in the <strong>Minor  Enhancements: 8.4</strong> section of the release notes) stated:<br>
    &ldquo;Validation has been added to Test Client so that it doesn&rsquo;t  allow the user to add more than one query parameter with the same name and a  different value.&rdquo;<br>
    In fact, Test Client does allow multiple query parameters with  the same name and a different value, which is per design and per guidelines for  REST APIs.The title of the article was accurate; validation was improved  for multiple query parameters.<br>
    This article has now been clarified (see <a href="#testclient-improved-validation">Test Client: Improved validation for multiple query parameters</a>).<br>

  <h5>Organization  Business/API Administrator unauthorized to view Admins for API</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where an organization was created and APIs were  then migrated to the organization, and the Business Administrator or API  Administrator role was assigned to a user via the <strong>Organization</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> roles page, when the user went to the <strong>Organizations</strong> menu and chose an API, the user could see the <strong>Admins</strong> left menu item, but on trying to access it, the user got a  401 Unauthorized error.<br>
    There are two ways a user can be made an API Admin in the  context of a business organization:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>By role assignment in the context of an  organization via <strong>Organization</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong>. These users have full access  rights to APIs within the organization, but do not have permission to view and  manage API Admins.</li>
    <li>By being invited to be an API Admin for a  specific API. These users have full rights to the API and can also view,  invite, or remove API Admins.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The problem was that users in category #1 above were able to see  the Admins left menu item but were not authorized to view it. Now, these users  do not see the Admins left menu item.<br>
    Users who are invited to an API have full permission to manage  the API and also API Admins for the API. These users see the left menu item and  can access it for viewing and making changes to the API Admin team.<br>

  <p>As a security measure, a new option was added to allow the Site  Admin to limit the scripting language supported by the API platform. For  example, the Site Admin could choose not to support Jython. Limiting the supported  scripting languages helps close the door on possible malignant efforts to hack  the system using those scripting languages.<br>
    The new setting is in the Akana Administration Console: <strong>Configuration</strong> &gt; <strong>com.soa.script.framework</strong>, as shown below.</p>

  <p>In some cases, the developer portal and/or Akana Administration  Console accepted user input that was formatted as JSON data; in other cases, if  certain special characters were provided as field input, such as %2F, %00, or  %7c, the platform returned an HTTP 500 message.<br>
    Field validation has been improved to resolve this issue.<br>

  <h5>Multiple  service errors in log file: &ldquo;No key found in WSDL for service&rdquo;</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where an implementation of the Akana API Platform  included multiple Network Directors, with services distributed across Network  Directors rather than all services hosted on all Network Directors, specific  errors were populating the log file. For services hosted on one Network  Director but not on a second, errors were generated to the log file for the  second Network Director instance, with the message:</p>
  <pre class="code">No key found in WSDL for service {service_name} </pre>
  <p>The services could be retrieved, but did not have an address or  service key element when the WDSL was retrieved by the Network Director, since  the service was not hosted on that specific container.<br>
    The platform has been changed so that these messages are recorded  as warnings rather than as errors.<br>

  <h5>JMS:  Potential timing problem</h5>
  <p>There was a timing problem with the JMS transport when Topics were  used with temporary, non-durable response destinations. The issue was that the  response consumer was created after the request was sent. This could result in  the response being posted to the response Topic before the consumer was  registered, at which point it would not receive the message.<br>

  <h5>Runtime  error from proxy created using swagger file</h5>
  <p>In a specific scenario, after upgrade to 8.4.3, there was an  issue with a proxy API created from a valid Swagger file uploaded to create the  API; the API endpoint was incorrect, and so it failed at runtime.

  <h5>Possible  denial of service vulnerability due to user avatar size parameter</h5>
  <p>The platform supports uploading of an image for several resources  including users, apps, APIs, and groups.<br>
    There was no file size restriction in the upload API; in  addition, the processing time compounded when larger size values were provided.<br>
    By using this API with a large size parameter, potentially in  multiple instances, it could be possible for an attacker to overload the  back-end processing and cause service outages.<br>
    These operations have now been changed so that the maximum file  upload size is a 1000-pixel square.<br>

  <h4 id="84-keyfeatures"><a></a>Key Features: 8.4</h4>
  <h5>Ability to  author and manage policies from within the developer portal</h5>
  <p>The developer portal now allows the Business Admin to manage  policies directly, via the user interface, without using the underlying  infrastructure (Policy Manager). Policies are set up in the context of a  specific business organization. All policy types are supported.<br>
    Support for policies allows the Business Admin to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a policy, including basic policy definition  and policy configuration details.</li>
    <li>Edit an existing policy.</li>
    <li>Create a new version of an existing policy  that&rsquo;s in Active state.</li>
    <li>Delete a policy.</li>
    <li>View all policies set up for a specific business  organization.</li>
    <li>Move a policy that&rsquo;s in Draft state from one  organization to another (once a policy is in Active state it cannot be moved).</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Ability to  manage API Gateways from within the developer portal</h5>
  <p>In previous versions of the developer portal, API Gateways, the  underlying OSGi containers with the features installed that support the  developer portal functionality, had to be set up, configured, and managed in  the underlying infrastructure such as Policy Manager.<br>
    Now, although the API Gateways must be separately created and  configured, the Business Admin can register, modify, and manage API Gateways  and clusters from within the developer portal.<br>
    The new functionality, accessed at the root level via <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>API Gateways</strong>, gives the Business Admin  broad capabilities to manage API Gateways and clusters for the tenant. The  Business Admin can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Register an API Gateway</li>
    <li>Add an API Gateway cluster</li>
    <li>When registering an API Gateway, define a new  API Gateway cluster on the fly, which will contain the new API Gateway</li>
    <li>Add or remove API Gateways from a cluster</li>
    <li>Move an API Gateway from one cluster to another</li>
    <li>View a list of standalone API Gateways and  clusters</li>
    <li>View details of an individual API Gateway,  cluster, or cluster member</li>
    <li>Edit metadata details for an API Gateway</li>
    <li>Edit an API Gateway inbound listener</li>
    <li>Configure or edit outbound keys/certificates for  an API Gateway or cluster</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>New  Lifecycle Coordinator feature allows management of API lifecycle stages</h5>
  <p>The platform includes a new feature, Lifecycle Coordinator, which  allows the Administrator to define a one-way topology that includes a chain of  environments reflecting the development lifecycle. For example, the topology  chain could be from <strong>Development</strong> to <strong>Testing</strong> to <strong>Staging</strong> to <strong>Production</strong>.  Each environment is a separate installation of the developer portal.<br>
    Lifecycle Coordinator is a standalone user interface that&rsquo;s  installed separately. The new feature also includes modifications to the  developer portal user interface to allow the API Admin to promote an API to the  next environment.<br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Lifecycle Coordinator</strong><br>
    Within the Lifecycle Coordinator, the authorized user can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Define and manage the environment topology (two  or more environments in a unidirectional chain).</li>
    <li>Set up processing rules that are executed when  an API is promoted from one specific environment to the next. For example:</li>
    <li>A rule might change the target URL host for the  physical services when an API is promoted from Staging to Production.</li>
    <li>A rule might deploy an API to different  deployment zones in the Production environment depending on the PCI  compatibility of the API.</li>
    <li>A rule might define an approval required for the  resource to be promoted to the next environment. If approval is required, the  resource will be in a <strong>Promotion Pending</strong> state  until the promotion is approved.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The new feature includes a new user permission for the user who  manages the Lifecycle Coordinator.<br>
    <strong>Developer Portal</strong><br>
    Within the developer portal user interface, the new feature  allows the API Admin or Business Admin to promote an API from the current  environment to the next step in the environment topology.<br>
    When the user in the developer portal promotes the API, the API  is passed to the Lifecycle Coordinator. The next steps are governed by the  process set up in the Lifecycle Coordinator. For example, if a manual approval  is required, approval is requested. If processing rules are in place, the rules  are applied to the data before it is promoted to the next environment. The  status of the promotion request is reflected in the developer portal user  interface; for example, <strong>Promoted</strong> or <strong>Promotion Pending</strong>.<br>
    <strong>Iterations</strong><br>
    A resource can be promoted to the next lifecycle stage multiple  times, each time being an iteration of the resource, to accommodate a  development scenario where multiple changes are made before the API is fully  mature and ready to move to the next stage.<br>
    For example, an API might be promoted from Development to  Testing, and some errors found in Testing. It can then be updated in the  Development environment and promoted to Testing again, possibly multiple times  until it fully passes Testing and is ready to be promoted to the next lifecycle  stage in the next environment.<br>
    In the Lifecycle Coordinator, each of these iterations is stored,  for historical tracking and non-repudiation.<br>
    <strong>Deployment</strong><br>
    In terms of deployment, the Lifecycle Coordinator can be co-located  with any one of the tenants, or it can stand alone and communicate remotely  with any of them.<br>
    <strong>API changes</strong><br>
    Corresponding API enhancements were developed to support these  features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Import/export of API for the Promotion feature</li>
    <li>New API for returning the default environment</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Ability to  move business resources from one organization to another</h5>
  <p>Within the developer portal, an authorized user can move  certain business resources from one organization to another. Resources that can  be moved include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>API</li>
    <li>App</li>
    <li>Policy</li>
    <li>Organization (moving a child business  organization to a new parent)</li>

  <h5>External  OAuth Provider Domain: Support of JWKS for OAuth access tokens</h5>
  <p>The platform now supports validation of JWS Bearer access tokens  with public keys in the JWK Set URI.<br>
    In addition, the External OAuth Provider Domain now supports  specifying signing source for asymmetric keys inline.<br>
    The External OAuth Provider Domain has been expanded to allow the  Administrator to set up the signing source when asymmetric keys for JWT Bearer  access token support are specified inline.<br>
    This field is used when the JWT Bearer access token is signed  with an asymmetric signature algorithm such as RSA.<br>
    In the developer portal, the new fields are in the External  OAuth Provider Domain setup, Tab 4, Access Token Validation, and appear when  the user checks the <strong>JWT Bearer Access  Token</strong> box and then, in the <strong>Signing  Keys</strong> section, chooses <strong>Asymmetric  Keys Inline</strong> as the source for signing keys. The choices are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>X.509 Certificate</li>
    <li>X.509 Certificate URL</li>
    <li>JWK Set URL</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the user chooses JWK Set URL, the JWKS endpoint must be  provided as part of the External OAuth Provider Domain configuration in the  Provider tab (Tab 3).<br>
    Per the OAuth specification, the external OAuth Provider might  choose to use the public key that&rsquo;s published via the JWKS endpoint.<br>
    Using the JWKS option requires use of the <strong>kid</strong> (Key ID parameter). If the JWKS endpoint response contains only  one <strong>kid</strong> parameter, the value might  not be preset. In this scenario, the public key corresponding to the <strong>kid</strong> parameter in the JWKS endpoint  response is used for signature verification. </p>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-19734 / ATMO-19754 {{OK MM 2/24}}</p>
  <h5>OpenID  Connect Relying Party domain: new option supports single-page applications</h5>
  <p>In some cases, during the OAuth process, the scopes might not yet  be available when the user is being redirected to the authentication provider.  For example, if you have a single-page application (SPA) and want to secure  your API with user roles, you might not be able to determine which roles to  allow until you&rsquo;ve authenticated the user.<br>
    The OpenID Connect Relying Party domain now includes additional  fields that allow users to specify extension properties to support this  scenario.<br>
    In the developer portal: <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Domains</strong> &gt; <strong>Add Domain</strong> &gt; <strong>OpenID Connect Relying Party</strong>. The new fields are on Tab 4,  Authentication. Here, the user can choose to use an extension property to send  the claims in the ID token, instead of in the access token which is the usual  behavior. The user can then specify the claim name. <br>
  </p>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-19593 / ATMO-19705</p>
  <h5>Increased  JMS Support</h5>
  <p>There are two enhancements to the platform&rsquo;s support of JMS  transactions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Retry for  JMS transactions:</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>As part of support of JMS transactions, the platform now  supports retrying delivery of messages with JMS failures. <br>
    If the platform is unable to place a message on an outbound JMS  queue, it returns an error but allows retrying. The JBI router can then attempt  failover to another endpoint.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Failover  for JMS transactions:</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The platform now supports failover to/from JMS endpoints.  Failover for JMS endpoints works in the same way as the existing support for  HTTP endpoints. <span class="source-hide">ATMO-18804 / ATMO-18805 / ATMO-19639</span><br>

  <h5>User can  enable/disable notification for API auto-connect</h5>
  <p>A new configuration option was added to the user profile settings  so that users can control whether they receive email notifications when an app  auto-connects to the API. Previously, emails were automatically generated on  auto-connect and users could not configure this option.<br>
    The new option is a checkbox in the <strong>Profile</strong> &gt; <strong>Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> page.<br>

  <h5>Lifecycle  Integration: expanded support including additional resource and artifact types</h5>
  <p>The platform now includes the following additional support for  Lifecycle Manager integration:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Support of custom metadata for users:  Administrators can now specify custom metadata for users in addition to other  types of custom metadata already supported (apps and APIs).</li>
    <li>Support of an additional artifact type, <strong>by-ref</strong>, for all resource types.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Support of custom metadata requires integration with the  Lifecycle Manager product.<br>

  <h5>API Admin  can specify a valid listener when adding/editing an implementation endpoint</h5>
  <p>When adding or editing an endpoint for an implementation in the  developer portal, the API Admin can now specify the listener, choosing from a  list of valid listeners available.<br>
    A new listener pull-down was added on the Protocol tabs for the  implementation. The user can specify a listener as part of adding a subsequent  implementation (the first is generated automatically as part of the API  creation process), or as part of editing any implementation. <br>
    If only one listener for a specific protocol is available for the  deployment zone, the listener pull-down does not appear.<br>
    Changes were made to the Deployment Zone REST API service for the  developer portal to support the new functionality.<br>

  <h5>API Admin  can now edit the design of a SOAP API</h5>
  <p>In previous versions of the product, users could update the  design for REST-based APIs, but for SOAP APIs created by uploading a WSDL file,  edit was not available.<br>
    Now, SOAP APIs can be edited by updating a new WSDL file for the  API or by providing the URL for the WSDL.<br>

  <h5>Support of  business organizations that can administer their own apps and APIs</h5>
  <p>The platform now allows authorized users to create business  organizations within the developer portal. Each business organization can have  its own apps and APIs. In addition, organizations can be nested. For example,  you could create a specific business organization and then create several child  organizations for the departments within the business organization.<br>
    Support of business organizations includes the ability to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add, view, edit, and delete an organization.</li>
    <li>View a list of organizations.</li>
    <li>Add, view, edit, and delete apps associated with  an organization.</li>
    <li>Add, view, edit, and delete APIs associated with  an organization.</li>
    <li>Perform all activities relating to apps and  APIs, such as creating contracts.</li>
    <li>Create a child organization that has its own  apps and APIs (supports a multi-level organization hierarchy).</li>
    <li>View a list of child organizations.</li>
    <li>View app and API metrics for a specific  organization.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the user interface, Business Admins see the Organizations  link in the top menu area, as shown below:<br>
    <img src="img/bus-apps-organizations.png" width="257" height="124" alt=""/><br>
    Users adding an organization specify Name, Description,  optional avatar, and Type:<br>
    <img src="img/bus-apps-add-org.png" width="756" height="206" alt=""/><br>
    Once the organization is defined, the Business Admin can  create and manage assets using the left menu, as shown below, including:</p>
  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="348" valign="top"><ul>
        <li>Organization details</li>
        <li>APIs</li>
        <li>Apps</li>
        <li>Child organizations</li>
        <li>Policies for the organization</li>
        <li>Processes for the organization</li>
        <li>Scripts for the organization</li>
        <li>Security roles within the organization</li>
        <li>Export/import of organization data.</li>
      </ul></td>
      <td width="291" valign="top"><p><img src="img/bus-apps-org-details.png" width="151" height="320" alt=""/></p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Apps and APIs created within the context of a specific  organization are not visible/accessible to organizations outside the  organization tree.<br>
    Security permissions can be set for the organization, in  detail, as shown below:<br>
    <img src="img/bus-apps-role-memberships.png" width="791" height="233" alt=""/><br>
    Security settings for a specific organization are entirely  independent of other organizations or the root organization.<br>
    This gives a lot of flexibility in managing multiple  organizations, including an organization hierarchy, on the platform.<br>

  <h5>When adding  a new API version, user can switch implementation pattern between Orchestration  and Proxy</h5>
  <p>In the past, a specific API was created with a specific  implementation pattern, Proxy or Orchestration. Once the API was created, new  versions of the same API would have the same implementation pattern; it could  not be changed.<br>
    Now, the platform supports creating a new API version and  changing the implementation pattern. </p>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-18065</p>
  <h5>Support of  user-defined custom properties for Apps, APIs, and Users</h5>
  <p>The platform now supports user-defined custom properties for  certain resources.<br>
    Specifically, in the 8.3 release, the platform supports  integration of extensible properties for apps and APIs. The 8.4 release added  support of extensible properties for users.<br>
    Support includes the following new features and changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A new Site Admin setting to enable or disable  custom properties.</li>
    <li>Support of extension properties for apps, as  defined in a template. Properties are:</li>
    <li>Collected in the <strong>Add App,</strong> <strong>Add App Version</strong> pages</li>
    <li>Displayed in the app&rsquo;s <strong>Details</strong> page</li>
    <li>Modified from the app&rsquo;s <strong>Details</strong> page via the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the new <strong>Properties</strong> section.</li>
    <li>Support of extension properties for APIs, as  defined in a template. Properties are:</li>
    <li>Collected in the <strong>Add API</strong> and <strong>Add API Version</strong> pages</li>
    <li>Displayed in the API&rsquo;s <strong>Details</strong> page</li>
    <li>Modified from the API&rsquo;s <strong>Details</strong> page via the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the new <strong>Properties</strong> section.</li>
    <li>Support of extension properties for users, as  defined in a template. Properties are:</li>
    <li>Collected in the <strong>Add User</strong> page and user profile page</li>
    <li>Displayed in the user&rsquo;s <strong>Details</strong> page</li>
    <li>Modified from the user profile.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Supported types of fields for extension properties in version 8.3  include Boolean, date, string, taxonomy, and others. Version 8.4 adds support  of additional artifact type, <strong>by-ref</strong>,  for all resource types.<br>
    Support for this feature requires that these steps be in  place:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The implementation must include the add-on  product, configured to use the same database as the developer portal.</li>
    <li>The applicable site setting (<strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Site</strong>) must be enabled. When this setting is enabled, properties  defined for supported assets in the developer portal can be extended by customizing  templates in the default Lifecycle Manager integration library.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Process  Editor changes</h5>
  <p>Changes were made to the Process Editor for enhanced usability:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Palette  now scrollable</strong>: The Process Editor palette, viewed within the developer  portal in some instances, is now scrollable so that even if there are custom  activities added to the palette, all activities are easily accessible.</li>
    <li><strong>Extendable  palette</strong>: The vertical height of the palette was extended to support  additional, optional icons. This allows support of the FreeMarker, Add/Modify  Headers, and Normalize activities.</li>
    <li><strong>Warning  message added</strong>: In Process Editor, users must save changes by using the <strong>Save</strong> icon on the palette. Previously,  if the user clicked <strong>Finish</strong> before  saving, the changes were lost. A warning message has been added so that if a  user clicks <strong>Finish</strong> with unsaved  changes, the user is prompted to save before exiting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Compliance-related  changes for SEO</h5>
  <p>The system includes a number of changes for better SEO:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Serve up <strong>robots.txt</strong> and <strong>sitemap.xml</strong> files based on the  site structure.</li>
    <li>Provide configurable site title and description.</li>
    <li>New fallback pages for public site content.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-16234 / ATMO-16235</p>
  <h5>Expanded  support of roles, with increased granularity and flexibility</h5>
  <p>The roles functionality of the developer portal has been expanded  and enhanced to include the ability to create and modify roles in the  underlying infrastructure, and assign those roles in the developer portal.<br>
    This provides much greater flexibility to manage roles at a more  granular level for the API platform.<br>
    Roles are made up of a set of permissions for the different  entities in an organization, such as APIs, apps, groups, and sub-organizations.  When a user is assigned a role within an organization, the user is granted the  associated permissions within that organization and all sub-organizations. The  System Administrator can define the roles and their associated permissions in  the Policy Manager console, including modifying out-of-the-box roles and adding  new roles. Those roles are then available in the Community Manager Organization  pages, where the Business Admin can assign specific roles to specific users.<br>
    The new functionality includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>New capability to manage permissions for core  resources on the API platform, from Policy Manager. This includes apps, APIs,  and groups, as well as business organizations.</li>
    <li>New capability in the developer portal to view  all roles defined at the organization level, and to assign roles to users.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Previously, the main roles and permissions within the developer  portal were Developer, API Admin, Business Admin, and Site Admin, and these  could not be fine-tuned. Now, permissions for those roles can be modified in  Policy Manager, and new roles can be defined in Policy Manager, at the root or  organization level, and assigned in the developer portal. Roles defined at the  root level are available for all organizations; roles defined for a specific  organization are available only for that organization and its sub-organizations  if there are any.</p>
  <h5>Refactoring  UI to support custom roles</h5>
  <p>In support of the new custom roles feature, the following  additional changes were made:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Existing pages and widgets were modified to  check the new permissions rather than the previous platform permissions  structure (Site Admin, Business Admin, etc.).</li>
    <li>UI framework files were updated to check  resource type and permission type before displaying a requested page to a  specific user.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Changing of  Business Admin and Site Admin roles to present a more distinct separation of  duties</h5>
  <p>Permissions for the functions on the Administration menu have  been modified to present a more distinct separation of duties. As a result, a  user who is only a Business Admin, or only a Site Admin, will see slightly  different options on this menu. Key changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Business  Admins</strong>: Site Admins can no longer add Business Admins; only a Business  Admin can make changes to the Business Admin group.</li>
    <li><strong>Scopes  and Licenses</strong>: Site Admins previously had view-only access to Scopes and  Licenses. These items no longer appear on the Site Admin menu. Business Admins  manage all functionality associated with these resources.</li>
    <li><strong>Workflows</strong>:  Site Admins previously had only view-only access to <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Workflows</strong>,  where custom workflows are uploaded, and Business Admins had full capability to  upload custom workflows. Now, the Workflows menu item no longer appears on the  Business Admin menu. Site Admins have full capability to upload custom  workflows, as well as to assign custom workflows to resources via the Settings  menu.</li>
    <li><strong>Domains  and Deployment Zones</strong>: Site Admins no longer manage Domains or Deployment  Zones; these functions are now managed by the Business Admin.</li>
    <li><strong>Forum</strong>:  Site Admins no longer have access to <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Forum</strong>; only a Business Admin  can moderate a forum from the Administration menu. API Admins can manage the  forums for their own APIs; in addition, each user now has his/her own Forum,  accessible via the top menu bar.</li>
    <li><strong>Actions</strong>:  The Actions function was previously on the Administration menu for the Site  Admin. This has been moved so that it is available to the Business Admin on the  Organization menu for each organization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>New  Organization &gt; Security page for managing roles in the API platform</h5>
  <p>To support the new features relating to expanded support of roles  and of organizations on the platform, the Business Admin for the business  organization can now manage roles and role membership.<br>
    For each business organization, the Security page lists valid  roles. The Business Admin can assign any user to any valid roles.</p>

  <h5>Developer  portal list pages changed to card format and driven by Search API</h5>
  <p>Several list pages in the developer portal were modified to a  more user-friendly card layout. These pages now use the Search API rather than  other API operations used previously. The list pages that use this layout  include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>List of organizations</li>
    <li>List of organizations within an organization</li>
    <li>List of APIs within an organization</li>
    <li>List of apps within an organization</li>
    <li>User-specific APIs list</li>

  <p>The top navigation bar now includes an additional link for each  user to access a personal Forum page.<br>
    The user forum includes all Forum entries (for example, tickets,  reviews, discussions) for all apps and APIs for which the user is an  administrator or team member. The Forum page includes filters for  published/unpublished content and for searching by forum entry type. It also  includes a general search bar.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-18942</span></p>
  <h5>New ability  to manage scripts in the developer portal</h5>

The previous wording, in release 8.4,  stated that validation has been added to Test Client so that it doesn&rsquo;t allow the  user to add more than one query parameter with the same name and a different  value. In fact, Test Client does allow multiple query parameters with the same  name and a different value, which is per design and per guidelines for REST  APIs.</em><br>

  <h5>Process  Editor: unsaved changes confirmation message added</h5>
  <p>The Process Editor includes a <strong>Save</strong> icon on the left menu bar. However, if the user doesn&rsquo;t click  Save, and then edits, there was previously no prompt to save changes.<br>
    A prompt has now been added to notify the user if there are  unsaved changes, before exiting from the Process Editor.<br>

  <h5>Improved  support of WSDL with long service/description</h5>
  <p>In some cases, import of a WSDL with long service/description  names caused an error, because the database did not support such long values.<br>
    Adjustments to the database have been made to improve support of  long service/description names in the WSDL, including increasing the side of  the applicable field.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-14646</p>
  <h5>More  specific error message on App URL field</h5>
  <p>Error messaging on URL fields was improved for scenarios where  the user didn&rsquo;t provide a fully-qualified URL.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-4841</p>
  <h5>All themes:  Minification of CSS files to help optimize page load time</h5>
  <p>CSS files used by the developer portal user interface were  minified (streamlined) to help improve page load time.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-14727</span></p>
  <h5>API Message  Board: Board posts trigger notifications to all followers of the API</h5>
  <p>Notification distribution has been expanded so that followers of  an API get notifications when someone posts to the API&rsquo;s Board.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-8376</p>
  <h5>Search  returns APIs and also all API versions</h5>
  <p>Previously, as well as APIs being returned in Search, each API version  was returned, resulting in at least two entries, possibly more, for the same  API. Search has been improved so that only one entry is returned for each API.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-9557, SUP-11914</p>
  <h5>Notifications:  when a group invitee is not a platform member, and then the invitation is  cancelled, user notification is sent</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where a group administrator invited another  individual to join the group, the user was not a platform member, and then the  group administrator cancelled the invitation, a notification was sent out  stating that a Site Admin had removed the user from the group. This has been  fixed so that no notification is sent in this scenario.<br>

  <p class="supID">SUP-10773</p>
  <h5>Changes to  Lifecycle Manager to support integrated CM/LM</h5>
  <p>Lifecycle Manager was enhanced to support integration with the  developer portal, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add asset create, update, and delete operations.</li>
    <li>Design and implementation of an initial default Lifecycle  Manager configuration for platform deployment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-17523 / ATMO-17524</p>
  <h5>Deployment  Zones map improvements</h5>
  <p>The visual map of deployment zones is displayed in several  different pages in the developer portal. Two improvements were made:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The code for displaying this map was unified and  optimized for efficiency.</li>
    <li>When navigating back and forth between View and  Edit, there were issues with the JavaScript execution timing, which have been  resolved.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-18226 / ATMO-18523</p>
  <h5>Workflow:  support of separate API Admin Group Membership workflow</h5>
  <p>The platform now supports defining a separate custom workflow for  API Admin group membership. Previously, a custom workflow could be specified  for Groups but not for API Admin Groups specifically.<br>
    The new setting is with the other configurable API settings: <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>APIs</strong>.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17336</span></p>
  <h5>New ability  to specify the container key for the default Deployment Zone for a new tenant</h5>
  <p>By default, creating a new tenant creates a deployment zone for  every Network Director container. When adding a new tenant via the platform  API, the user can now pass in an array of container keys. Only those deployment  zones are created.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-18613 for 8.2 4 / ATMO-18254 for 8.3</p>
  <h5>Optimization  to speed initial load of invoke activity</h5>
  <p>A change was made to the way the invoke activity loads, which  previously ran the search so that the list of all APIs in the system shows in  the drop-down list. Instead, it now shows the selected APIs, or doesn&rsquo;t  populate the drop-down list until the user runs a search, which is more  efficient.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-18369</p>
  <h5>Support of  OAuth scopes now includes OR as well as AND</h5>
  <p>The platform previously supported multiple OAuth domains, but all  scopes had to be included in the grant.<br>
    Now, support has been added for allowing multiple scopes,  using any of the scopes that are defined in the grant (OR) as well as AND which  was already supported.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-13062</p>
  <h5>Enhancements  to Swagger support</h5>
  <p>The following are enhancements to the platform&rsquo;s support of  Swagger API description documents:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The platform now supports resolving links to  external files in Swagger definitions. Previously, external references in the  Swagger definition were not supported; only local references worked. Local and  external references are now supported.</li>
    <li>The platform now supports the ability to resolve  reusable parameter definitions in Swagger documents.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="supID">SUP-13049, SUP-13920</p>
  <h5>All themes:  Display of user&rsquo;s last login timestamp</h5>
  <p>The developer portal UI now displays the date/time of the user&rsquo;s  last login. The information is displayed in the top menu bar with the user&rsquo;s  name.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-18721</p>
  <h5>Markdown  for Apps and APIs</h5>
  <p>In version 8.2, an API&rsquo;s single description field supported  Markdown and up to 4000 characters. An app&rsquo;s single description field did not  support Markdown, and could hold only 255 characters.<br>
    In 8.3, two different fields are defined to describe an API or  app: a summary field (255 characters, plain text) and a description field (4000  characters, Markdown). The summary field is used to describe APIs and apps in  list pages and search results. The description field is only displayed when  viewing the Details page for the app or API.<br>
    Because of the previous inconsistency in the use of the  description field, when upgrading from 8.2 you&rsquo;ll notice that the content in  the app&rsquo;s previous description field is now displayed in the summary field, and  the description field is empty. The API&rsquo;s description field will still appear  the same, but list pages will not show any descriptive text since the summary  will be empty. You&rsquo;ll notice the same changes if you&rsquo;re using the Community  Manager API. If you&rsquo;re using the Description field of an app through the API,  this field will be blank after upgrade. You can retrieve the old description by  using the Summary field rather than the Description field.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-18567</p>
  <h5>Expanded/enhanced  AMQP support</h5>
  <p>Several changes were made to expand and improve, AMQP support,  including these enhancements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The platform now supports AMQPS for physical  services. </li>
    <li>Platform support of AMQP was expanded to include  support of virtual hosts without a leading forward slash (/) in the virtual  host name.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, these issues with AMQP support were resolved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Default AMQP exchange should be blank and left  to the broker.</li>
    <li>When creating AMQP messages with non-string  message parts, the wrong content was sent. </li>
    <li>With a proxy API implementation, if the physical  service had an AMQP endpoint, the implementations were not loading.</li>
    <li>In the user interface, when adding an API, an  AMQP endpoint was not accepted; an error was generated.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-18871 for 8.2.6 / ATMO-18861 for 8.3 / 2 ALSO ATMO-18882  for 8.2.6 / ATMO-18880 for 8.3</p>
  <h5>Support for  PingFederate 8.1.x</h5>
  <p>The platform now supports PingFederate 8.1.x. <br>
  </p>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-19008</p>
  <h5>Elasticsearch  now supports secure connections</h5>
  <p>In previous versions, all Elasticsearch communication were via  non-secure communication. Elasticsearch can now be configured to support secure  communications.<br>
    Elasticsearch now supports the following additional properties to  support secure connections:</p>

  <h4><a name="84-api-interface-changes">API Interface Changes: 8.4</a></h4>
  <h5>New API for  configuration of Elasticsearch</h5>
  <p>Elasticsearch configuration is required as part of the process of  setting up the Community Manager container. To facilitate automation, a new API  service was introduced for configuration of Elasticsearch, so that this process  can be completed outside the user interface.<br>
    The new operation is: </p>
  <pre class="code">PUT /api/index/{ContainerKey}/nodeconfig

Content-Type: application/json

Accept application/json </pre>

  <h5>Ability to  manage apps or APIs for a business organization from an API client </h5>
  <p>As an extension of the new support of business organizations,  the platform API was enhanced to support managing apps or APIs for a specific  business organization. Support includes the following operations that can be  performed from an API client:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to add, edit, or delete an API for an  organization or list APIs for an organization.</li>
    <li>Ability to add, edit, or delete an app for an  organization or list apps for an organization.</li>

  <h5>Ability to  manage business organizations from an API client </h5>
  <p>As an extension of the new support of business organizations,  the platform API was enhanced to support managing business organizations.  Support includes the following operations that can be performed from an API  client:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add an organization as the child of an existing  organization</li>
    <li>Update an organization</li>

    <li>List child organizations for a specified  organization</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Deployment  Zones: Issues with multiple listeners of the same protocol</h5>
  <p>The following issues were resolved to manage scenarios where  multiple listeners might be available for the same protocol:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Multiple  listeners of same protocol not distinguishable on deployment zones</strong>
      <p>If multiple listeners were added using the same protocolâ€”for  example, two HTTPS listenersâ€”there was no way to differentiate between them  when selecting a listener on the Deployment Zones page.<br>
        The user interface has now been modified so that multiple  listeners of the same protocol can be uniquely identified.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>With multiple listeners of same protocol, only one listener gets selected</strong>
      <p>In a scenario where there was more than one listener of the same  protocol, for example two HTTPS listeners, only one listener was available for  selection from within the API implementation definition.<br>
        If the deployment zone has two listeners, the API implementation  is created with one listener. The user interface allows adding another  listener, but when the user chose all protocols, the second listener was still  not available. This has been fixed.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="supID">SUP-12975 / SUP-12976</p>
  <h5>System  health tool bundle not installing correctly</h5>
  <p>There was a problem with the system health tool if it was  installed with Community Manager. After installation, the health tool tab was  not created, and the container did not work correctly.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13338</span></p>
  <h5>SOAP API: after  updating schema for existing operation, &ldquo;process not found&rdquo;</h5>
  <p>After updating the schema for an existing operation in a SOAP  service, when there were processes associated with the service, the platform  was logging an error:</p>
  <pre class="code">No process found for {operation_name} operation of service  {service_name} </pre>
  <p class="supID">SUP-13660 / SUP-13433</p>
  <h5>Message  variables not passed from parent process to sub-process</h5>
  <p>There was a problem with message variables not being available to  sub-processes. In addition, when the message variable was not initialized in  the main flow, no audit logs were recorded.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13798</span></p>
  <h5>New child organization visible in Policy Manager but  developer portal shows no child organizations</h5>
  <p>When a child organization was created in the developer portal,  the new organization was visible in Policy Manager but not visible in the  developer portal.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13813</span></p>
  <h5>Adding an  Auditing Message Policy, with masking, to an API with Auditing Service Policy suppresses  the Detailed Auditing output in Monitoring &gt; Logs</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where a proxy API was created and an auditing  service policy, such as the Detailed Auditing policy, was assigned to the API,  and then an Auditing Message policy was added with a mask to protect specific content,  the Detailed Auditing policy output was suppressed in the develop portal, in <strong>Analytics</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong>.<br>
    This has now been fixed so that in this scenario an API with both  these policies, and with specific information masked, shows the entire  transaction response, with the masked portions obscured or removed.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13398</span></p>
  <h5>Default  Theme: &ldquo;Unauthorized&rdquo; alert when adding a group</h5>
  <p>If a Business Admin was trying to add a group, and tried to  browse the members or admins sections, the following alert was displayed:</p>
  <pre class="code">You are not authorized to view this page. </pre>
  <p class="supID">SUP-13819, SUP-13942</p>
  <h5>When  importing API information, original access point is lost</h5>
  <p>After creating the physical service and virtualizing it on a  container with a single inbound listener, and then adding a second access point  to the virtual service, when the service was exported and then imported into a  new environment, only the second access point was created in the new  environment. The first access point was lost.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13944</span></p>
  <h5>Swagger: Response  schemas for status codes other than 200 are omitted</h5>
  <p>No content was shown for responses for status codes other than  200 when schemas were specified, when using Swagger documents for creating an  API.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13919</span></p>
  <h5>Policy  Manager: When exporting organization rollups, column name is misspelled in  export data</h5>
  <p>In Policy Manager, when deleting old rollup data, errors were  generated because a column name in the rollup data file was cut off (MINMSGSIZ,  should be MINMSGSIZE).<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14059</span></p>
  <h5>Policy  Manager: Errors generated when changing service organization</h5>
  <p>In Policy Manager, running the <strong>Change Organization</strong> wizard to move physical services to a different  service organization resulted in an error.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13746</span></p>
  <h5>With Ping  feature, Network Director might fail to deploy virtual services</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where the Ping feature was installed, in some cases  the Network Director failed to deploy virtual services due to a race condition  bug.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14033</span></p>
  <h5>SOAP-based  API: design update error</h5>
  <p>When a specific API, created from a WSDL file, was published  from Lifecycle Manager to the developer portal, and then the API design was modified  in the developer portal by uploading the same WSDL file again, exception errors  were generated to the Policy Manager log.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14098</span></p>
  <h5>Hermosa  theme: inactive session expiration not working correctly</h5>
  <p>The setting that controls inactive login session timeout (<strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Login</strong>) was not working for Hermosa theme. This setting now works  for all themes.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13937</span></p>
  <h5>API created  from Swagger document: response schema not recognized on import</h5>
  <p>When an API was created by importing a Swagger API description  document, certain response schemas were not recognized. For example, when  trying to update a specific operation to specify the response schema, the  schema name was not displayed for selection even after it had been added. <br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13844, SUP-13901</span></p>
  <h5>SLA  policies attached to an API do not generate developer portal notifications</h5>
  <p>When a service level alert (SLA) policy was attached to an API  and an alert was triggered as a result of a policy violation, Dashboard alerts  were not being generated in the developer portal. If the policy was attached at  the contract level and a violation occurred, a Dashboard alert was generated.<br>
    This has been fixed so that Alerts/Notifications for SLA  policies associated with API implementations/services are generated in the same  way that they are generated for contracts.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13377, SUP-13485</span></p>
  <h5>When  creating API from Swagger description, special characters in parameter name are  converted to underscore</h5>
  <p>When an API was created by importing a Swagger API description  document, the parameter name was not correctly rendered if the name included  special characters.<br>
    For example, [VAL] in a query parameter name in the imported API  description document was represented as _VAL_ in the resulting API. This was  also the case in the service WSDL for the virtual service in Policy Manager.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14062</span></p>
  <h5>Exporting  logs only exports a single row</h5>
  <p>Clicking <strong>Analytics</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong> &gt; <strong>Export</strong> was resulting in export of the first row of the results, not  the entire log.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13488, SUP-14083, SUP-14121</span></p>
  <h5>After 8.3  upgrade, cannot delete a business if it has an associated API that was deleted  prior to the upgrade</h5>
  <p>After upgrade to 8.3, there was a problem deleting a business  if there were any associated APIs that had been deleted prior to the upgrade.  If an organization included an API that was then deleted, a database reference  was left intact. This prevented the organization itself from being deleted.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13990</span></p>
  <h5>SQL  injection attack possible from API operation to export transaction logs</h5>
  <p>A security vulnerability was identified with the operation to  export transaction logs: GET&nbsp;/api/apps/versions/{version  id}/txlogs/export.Â  A  specific parameter was found to be vulnerable, and was fixed. <br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14224</span></p>
  <h5>Search not  updating visibility correctly</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where an API was imported with a specific  visibility, the visibility was changed, and the API was then deleted and  re-imported, the Search feature was using the revised visibility setting for  the initial import, rather than the setting for the re-imported API.<br>
    This was caused by a delay in queuing the API for reindexing. The <strong>Edit API Details</strong> feature has now  been modified to immediately queue modified objects for indexing.<br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: There might  still be a short delay before a queued object is picked up for search indexing.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14002</span></p>
  <h5>Regression  in HTTP Security Policy</h5>
  <p>A regression in the HTTP Security Policy meant that it was not  possible to authenticate a subject using another policy and then use the HTTP  Security Policy to insert the associated SSO session cookie into the response  returned to the client. In previous versions, this had been supported. This regression  has been fixed so that this functionality is again available.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13799 </span></p>
  <h5>API  platform does not accept and validate &ldquo;--&rdquo; as part of the URL for an API  endpoint</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where a user was creating an API from scratch, the  platform would not accept a URL that included two consecutive dashes. Instead,  an error was returned.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13686</span></p>
  <h5>SOAP API: Creating  a SOAP-based API via imported WSDL in the developer portal adds policies on  Design service rather than Target service</h5>
  <p>When a SOAP API was created in the developer portal by importing  a WSDL file, the policies were created as design artifacts of the API rather  than as part of the target physical service (the physical service that the  implementation uses).<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14233</span></p>
  <h5>SOAP API: Creating  a SOAP-based API via imported WSDL changes the workflow state of policies  attached to the API</h5>
  <p>After creating an API by importing a WSDL, either in Policy  Manager or in the developer portal, although the policies attached to the API  were in Active state, after import the associated policies were in Draft state.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14234</span></p>
  <h5>Test  Client: 404 error when accessing external OAuth token endpoint</h5>
  <p>Test Client was returning a 404 error when an API call was  requesting a token from an external OAuth provider, although the token URL  worked when using a standalone client.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13927</span></p>
  <h5>API  Platform Documentation: clarification re &ldquo;mail to&rdquo; address</h5>
  <p>The documentation was clarified with regard to the places in the  user interface where the &ldquo;mail to&rdquo; address can be set up, and the interrelation  between the different places.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14221</span></p>
  <h5>Internet  Explorer 11: Inline Test Client in authored documentation not working correctly</h5>
  <p>Including inline Test Client in authored documentation worked  well when viewed on Chrome or Firefox, but did not work correctly with Internet  Explorer 11. Instead, there was a progress indicator for a long time and Test  Client never appeared.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14193</span></p>
  <h5>Outbound  emails getting stuck in the message queue</h5>
  <p>Outbound emails were getting stuck in the message queue (MSG_QUEUE),  with the following error generated to the log files: &ldquo;Error in decoding the  message.&rdquo;<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13911</span></p>
  <h5>Wrong value  used in developer portal logs if next hop time is 0</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where an API request was rejected, so that next hop  time was actually 0 since the request was not relayed, the logs in the  developer portal (<strong>API</strong> &gt; <strong>Analytics</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong>) showed the transaction time for the back-end portion of the  message relay with the same value as the transaction time for the completed  request.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14209</span></p>
  <h5>In  Operational Script policy, not able to save certain foreign-language characters</h5>
  <p>Certain foreign-language characters were not being saved  correctly, when added as a literal string in the Operational Script policy.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14184</span></p>
  <h5>Email  alerts not showing the correct value for Alert Origination Date</h5>
  <p>After upgrade, email alerts that include the Alert Origination Date  were generated with an incorrect value for this field.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14031 </span></p>
  <h5>Error in  conversion from string to FDN</h5>
  <p>There was a bug in the conversion of a string to an FDN (fully  distinguished name; for example, {uniqueid}.{FedMemberID}. In scenarios where  there were multiple dots in the string, the first dot was identified as the  separator, resulting in an invalid FedMemberID if there were multiple dots in  the string. For example, a string of abc.def.fedmember was converted so that  the FedMemberID would be def.fedmember.<br>
    This has been modified so that the string after the last dot is  used as the FedMemberID.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14553</span></p>
  <h5>After  cloning an API that included a process, no process found in the cloned API</h5>
  <p>When an API included a process and the API was cloned, after  cloning, the API was generating the following error, even though in the user  interface the process appeared to be there:</p>
  <pre class="code">No process found for [postorder] operation of service </pre>
  <p class="supID">SUP-14390</p>
  <h5>When  registered users have permission to add an API, registered user who is not an  API Admin can approve his or her own API access request</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where the platform defaults had been modified to  allow registered users to add an API, a registered user who requested access to  an API was able to authorize the API access request even though the user was  not an API Admin for the API. This has now been fixed. Only a Business Admin or  an API Admin for the applicable API can approve an API access request.<br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: By default,  registered users do not have permission to add an API. This issue occurred only  when the default user permissions were modified.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14315</span></p>
  <h5>std.out  file growing unmanageably large when API traffic is heavy</h5>
  <p>In some cases, when API traffic was heavy, the <strong>std.out</strong> log files in the Network Director  instance/log directory were growing very large, eventually exhausting disk  storage. This occurred after upgrade from 8.0 to 8.2.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-14387</span></p>
  <h5>Upgrade  task &ldquo;Upgrade CM Models&rdquo; fails when migrating old APIs if WSDL operation names include  special characters</h5>
  <p>Some APIs created in earlier versions of the platform had special  characters in them. The upgrade task Upgrade CM Models was failing with these  APIs.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13749</span></p>
  <h5>When export  of organization information includes App data, export fails</h5>
  <p>When users tried to export business information from the  developer portal, if app data was included in the selections, the export  failed, and the following error message was generated:</p>
  <pre class="code">Error occurs while exporting objects of type [Business].</pre>
  <p class="supID">SUP-14650, SUP-13892 </p>
  <h5>Search API returning  incorrect character in search results</h5>
  <p>Search was returning search results that included an incorrect  character in the URL, a question mark (?) rather than a slash (/), so the URLs  did not work correctly unless modified.</p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-14292</p>
  <h5>API  Platform upgrade to 8.2.10: Update of a REST service fails</h5>
  <p>Update of REST service was failing due to unnecessary WSDL  validation steps.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-14701</p>
  <h5>Policy  Manager upgrade 7.2.1 to 8.2: ALTER TABLE actions failed for three fields</h5>
  <p>When upgrading from Policy Manager 7.2.1 to 8.2, the following  errors were generated in the logs:</p>
  <pre class="code">2017-01-13 16:52:23,321 ERROR [Thread-25]  AbstractDatabaseAdmin - Failed to execute: ALTER TABLE

  <p class="supID">SUP-14477</p>
  <h5>API Swagger  generation includes elements that fail validation</h5>
  <p>The Swagger document created by the API Designer included certain  elements that caused it to fail validation when validated at the Swagger online  validation tool, <a href="http://editor.swagger.io">http://editor.swagger.io</a>.<br>
    For example, it was changing <strong>type:integer</strong> to <strong>int</strong>.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-14755</p>
  <h5>Policy  Manager: When trying to update physical service, p&ldquo;CSRF Attack Detected&rdquo; message</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where a SOAP API needed to be updated, in Policy  Manager, choosing the Update Service action and uploading a ZIP archive with  updated WSDL and associated XSD files caused the following error:</p>
  <pre class="code">CSRF Attack Detected. </pre>
  <p class="supID">SUP-13976</p>
  <h5>User is  added in Policy Manager as an API Owner, but Add API is not available in the  developer portal</h5>
  <p>When a user was added to the list of API owners in Policy  Manager, the user was not able to add a new API in the developer portal. The  Add API option was not available.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-14494</p>
  <h5>Default  Theme: Fixed alignment issue in Add OAuth Provider Wizard</h5>
  <p>The Add OAuth Provider Wizard, Tab 2, Grant Types, includes a  field, <strong>Client Restriction Settings</strong>,  with two buttons. There was an alignment error in the buttons; this has been  fixed so that alignment is consistent across all fields.</p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-14457</p>
  <h5>Security  question that the user has already answered is still on the selection list</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where users were providing the answers to security  questions, if a user chose a question and answered it, then went on to the next  question, the first question still appeared on the list. Now, any question that  the user has already answered is removed from the selection list for subsequent  questions.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-5176</span></p>
  <h5>Search for  an API with a leading hyphen returns all APIs</h5>
  <p>In the platform&rsquo;s search tool, a search for an API with a  leading hyphen in the API name returned all APIs, because the hyphen is a  reserved character in the search engine. The reserved characters are:<br>
    <strong>+ - = &amp;&amp; || &gt;  &lt; ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ &quot; ~ * ? : \ /</strong><br>
    Users searching for text that includes special characters must  escape the characters. For example, to search for (123)app, you&rsquo;d have to  search for the following: <strong>\(123\)app</strong>.<br>
    When naming platform resources such as apps and APIs, it&rsquo;s best  to steer clear of special characters. When searching for resources, escaping  the special characters ensures the expected results.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-1185 </span></p>
  <h5>Search by  email ID is case sensitive</h5>
  <p>In version 8.0, the search on the Users List was case-sensitive.  This meant that if the search did not have the exact case that had been set up  for the email, a match was not found. This has been fixed so that email search  is performed regardless of case.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11006 / SUP-9865, SUP-6061, SUP-2668 </span></p>
  <h5>Deleting or  Modifying OAuth domain with a slash (/) in the name causes errors</h5>
  <p>If an OAuth domain name included a forward slash, there was a  problem modifying or deleting the domain. This has been fixed.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-9885</span></p>
  <h5>Test  Client: Certificate based authentication fails</h5>
  <p>Certificate-based authentication was failing in version 8.0 of  the developer portal, when using Test Client. If an API was secured, invoking  the API over the HTTPS endpoint in Test Client was returning an Authorization  error.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-9880</span></p>
  <h5>Customization:  Documentation widget was requiring minimum height of 550px</h5>
  <p>When customizing a platform page, there was a constraint that the  content could not be less than 550 pixels in height. This has been fixed so  that the height of frames is the height as specified by the user plus an extra  padding of 50px for each frame.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11013</span></p>
  <h5>PingFederate  Domain: incorrect lookup for Client Registration URL returns exception when not  found</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where the domain type was the legacy PingFederate  domain and the Client Registration endpoint was not enabled, the platform was  looking for the Client Registration URL, which it should not in this scenario,  and was returning an exception because it was not found. It should only look up  the Client Registration URL if the domain type is External OAuth Provider and  the Provider type is PingFederate. This has been fixed so that if the Client  Registration URL is not defined in the well-known configuration file, the  platform treats it as though client registration is disabled.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11036</span></p>
  <h5>&ldquo;Plus menu&rdquo;  is now hidden when there are no entries</h5>
  <p>Items on the Plus Menu, in the top menu bar in all themes, are  controlled by platform settings. This includes options such as adding a new  API, app, or group. If all items were turned off, the Plus icon was still  visible with no available choices. Now, the Plus icon is hidden if there are no  available items due to platform settings.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10589</span></p>
  <h5 id="SUP-11075">Add API: Adding the context path with an extra space or  special character fails</h5>
  <p>When an API was added with a context path that included an extra  space or special character, the API was failing, with a General System Error.<br>
    The platform has been modified so that the API context path is  appropriately validated. Invalid values in the context path are not allowed,  and if the user attempts to use invalid values, an appropriate message is  returned. Validation rules for the context path:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It cannot include spaces.</li>
    <li>Forward slash (/) and hyphen (-) are allowed.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: this article has  been corrected in version 8.4.7.  The following two items, which are erroneous, have been removed from the list  of validation rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It cannot include special characters.</li>
      <li>Question mark (?) is not allowed.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p class="supID">SUP-11075</p>
  <h5>Issues with  links in content files (both absolute and relative paths)</h5>
  <p>In scenarios where platform content files had links in the  content, for both relative and absolute paths, links were not being correctly  interpreted by the developer portal, resulting in errors. For example:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>&lt;a href=&quot;..relative-path&quot;&gt;  became #/home/landing?/current-content-path..relative-path</li>
    <li>&lt;a href=&quot;absolute-path&quot;&gt; became  #/home/landing?absolute-path</li>
  </ol>
  <p>#1 above resulted in long and inaccurate URLs; #2 resulted in a  204 response as the requested page did not exist.<br>
    Now, both relative and absolute  links display correctly in the address bar and the content is correctly  accessed.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10636</span></p>
  <h5>Google  Analytics support not recording page view for page accessed from server</h5>
  <p>When Google Analytics was set up for the developer portal, the  page view was being recorded on a change of window location, but not for the  initial page accessed from the server. Only a change of developer portal page  was recorded.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-5481</span></p>
  <h5>Disabled  user account still receives email notifications</h5>
  <p>When the account of a developer portal user was disabled, email  notifications were still being sent to the user for certain events such as an  invitation to be a Site Admin, Business Admin, or API Admin.<br>
    The platform has now been modified so that these types of  notifications are not sent to a user if the user&rsquo;s account is disabled.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12190</span></p>
  <h5>OAuth:  Unexpected errors in the OAuth Provider log file</h5>
  <p>In a specific scenario, errors such as the below were being  generated in the log file from a scheduled job:</p>
  <pre class="code">Attempting to invoke method refresh on  com.soa.oauth.client.provider.CachedOAuthClientProvider</pre>
  <p>This was due to a problem with the OAuth application cache having  a null value for the provider domain. <br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12255</span></p>
  <h5>If WSDL  includes one operation with two bindings, only one operation is displayed</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where an API had multiple operations and bindings,  if the same operation existed for two bindings (for example, SOAP 1.1 and SOAP  1.2), only one operation was displayed for both bindings. Both operations are  now correctly displayed, along with the applicable SOAP version.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12263, SUP-12320</span></p>
  <h5>API  Designer: Query parameter shouldn't be allowed in the operation path</h5>
  <p>In version 8.2, the API Designer allowed query parameters to be  added to the path. If a query parameter was added, the system incorrectly  created it as a path parameter.<br>
    This has now been modified so that query parameters cannot be  added onto the path. The user interface doesn&rsquo;t allow the addition of the  question mark (?) on the path of an operation.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12207</span></p>
  <h5>Test Client:  improved treatment of response content for display in Pretty tab</h5>
  <p>There were issues with Test Client&rsquo;s treatment of certain  content-types, and large responses, with regard to display in the Pretty tab.<br>
    Displaying certain types of content, such as images, requires a  second API call. The additional factor of security further complicated the  processing needed to correctly render these types of responses.<br>
    The following fixes have been made to improve performance and  behavior:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Test Client does not populate content for the  Pretty tab unless the user clicks the tab. This results in a performance  improvement, particularly if the response content is large.</li>
    <li>If the response is a format other than <strong>text</strong>, <strong>xml</strong>, <strong>json</strong>, or <strong>form-url-encoded</strong>, and when security  policies are attached to the API, two things occur when the user clicks the  Pretty tab:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If  the request <strong>can</strong> be completed by  sending the required authorization info as query parameters, the user interface  makes a second API call to display the content in the Pretty tab.</li>
      <li>If  the request <strong>cannot</strong> be completed by  sending the required authorization info as query parameters, the user interface  displays a message that the content cannot be displayed, and does not make the  second API call.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <p class="supID">SUP-12319</p>
  <h5>In imported  Swagger doc, sequence of request parameters not rendered correctly</h5>
  <p>When a Swagger document was imported to the developer portal, the  request parameters were not displayed in the same sequence as they were listed  in the Swagger document, but the sequence was not alphabetical.<br>
    Inconsistencies have been fixed. Now, the parameters always  default to display in an alphabetical sequence, regardless of the sequence in  the Swagger file.<br>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When new  parameters are added, they are displayed at the bottom of the list until they are saved. When the page is refreshed, everything is sorted alphabetically.</span></p>
  <p class="supID">SUP-12771 / SUP-13049</p>
  </p>
  <h5>Federation:  Issue with tenant causes CM process to run out of memory when indexing multiple  federated tenants</h5>
  <p>When multiple tenants were federated in the same instance, one of  the indexing jobs had the possibility of running infinitely, causing an out of  memory error.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12823</span></p>
  <h5>Hybrid  environment: errors and inconsistent behavior for Edit Deployment Zones</h5>
  <p>In a hybrid environment (on-prem Network Director, Cloud-based  EAP developer portal), Edit Deployment Zone was returning errors, with  inconsistent behavior.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12773 / SUP-12966 / SUP-12938</span></p>
  <h5>Federation:  Authorization issues</h5>
  <p>In a specific scenario, there was a problem with authorization  with federation. The developer portal was returning HTTP 500.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12908</span></p>
  <h5>Hermosa  Theme: for user profile, items on side menu do not expand correctly</h5>
  <p>Using an API Platform tenant, when a logged-in user views the  user&rsquo;s own profile, the left menu that contains additional user choices was not  displaying correctly for some items. Instead, the left menu and the resulting  page overlapped.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12898</span></p>
  <h5>For JMS  listeners in an ND Cluster, null value listeners are created in Community  Manager</h5>
  <p>If a Network Director cluster had JMS listeners, a new listener  tab with a null value was displayed in Community Manager. If the cluster had  HTTP/HTTPS listener types, everything was displayed as expected.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12773 / SUP-12938</span></p>
  <h5>Deployment  Zone for API Implementation: hostname value display is incorrect</h5>
  <p>When a new deployment zone was added, with the <strong>Allow APIs to specify vanity URLs (CNAMEs)</strong> cleared in the Deployment Zone configuration page, there was a display error.  In the Deployment Zones display page, the hostname was displayed in the <strong>Provide Vanity Hostname</strong> field, and the <strong>Hostname</strong> field did not show a value.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12970</span></p>
  <h5>Fix the  profile name for users in a tenant</h5>
  <p>In the past, the profile name for a user who signed up on the  platform was a concatenation of the user&rsquo;s first name and last name; for  example, if John Smith signed up, the username would be JohnSmith. Now, the profile name can be specified separately. Users can  modify this value on the <strong>Profile</strong> &gt; <strong>Details</strong> page.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12981</span></p>
  <p class="source-hide">ATMO-18414</p>
  <h5>OAuth: Error  while validating token null</h5>
  <p>In a specific scenario, there was a problem with calling APIs  using OAuth. Even though the request included a valid OAuth token, the response  generated the following error:</p>
  <pre class="code">Error occurred while validating token null </pre>
  <p>In some cases, the same token worked when used again.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10245</span></p>
  <h5>Simple Dev  Theme: When referencing documentation, Markdown doesn't work</h5>
  <p>In Simple Developer theme, in a specific scenario, when Markdown  was used in the API description, the Markdown didn&rsquo;t take effect for the  display. Instead, the Markdown characters were displayed; for example, *Note*  would display as-is, with asterisks, rather than <strong>Note</strong> as it would if the Markdown took effect.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12744</span></p>
  <h5>AutoConnect  to an API not working if non-admin user created the app</h5>
  <p>In version 8.2, if a user who was not a Business Admin or a  Site Admin created an app, auto-connect contracts were not automatically  created when that app connected to APIs with auto-connect enabled.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12813</span></p>
  <h5>Test  Client: integrated Test Client not working for generated API doc if OAuth  scopes are at the operation level rather than API-wide scopes</h5>
  <p>For an API that used OAuth scopes assigned at the operation  level, the integrated Test Client in authored API documentation was failing to  get the authorization token. For API-wide scopes, this issue did not occur.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10836 </span></p>
  <h5>Test Client  hangs when response data type is &ldquo;double&rdquo;</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where the response to an API was a specific data  type, <strong>double</strong>, Test Client was  hanging and not completing the action to display the response. Page refresh was  required before invoking again.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13512</span></p>
  <h5>Test  Client: Custom header added in Parameters section of API Designer does not  display correctly</h5>
  <p>If a custom header was entered in the Parameters section of the  API Designer, as a header parameter, it was not treated as a header in Test  Client. Instead, it was shown in the parameters section and could not be seen  in the request headers.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13556, SUP-13509</span></p>
  <h5>API legal  agreement in PDF format appears very small in API Access wizard</h5>
  <p>When a PDF legal agreement was uploaded and published for an API  (<strong>API Details</strong> &gt; <strong>Agreements</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage Files</strong>), the display of the PDF, when viewed by a user in the  API Access wizard, was too small to be easily readable.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13125</span></p>
  <h5>In a  cluster scenario, JMS endpoints not deployed</h5>
  <p>In version 8.2, when a JMS listener was created in a cluster  scenario and a JMS web service was hosted on the cluster, the cluster nodes were  not given any endpoints and therefore messages were not picked up.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12779</span></p>
  <h5>Errors when  editing a live implementation</h5>
  <p>In version 8.2, under specific circumstances, there were  errors in editing a live implementation of a newly-created API.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12760</span></p>
  <h5>Upgrade CM models  task returning errors with some APIs</h5>
  <p>When upgrading from 8.0 to 8.2.1, the upgrade task to add the  design service to APIs created in CM 8.0 was failing. This occurred if an  operation name had a slash in the definition (for example, GET /orders). The <strong>Upgrade CM Models</strong> task returned a  message &ldquo;Some of the model objects are not updated&rdquo; and the upgrade failed for  that API.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13008</span></p>
  <h5>issue with  Upgrade CM Models post-install task </h5>
  <p>The post-install task Upgrade CM Models was returning a Null  Pointer Exception error for certain APIs. The pattern finder was expecting the  next hop, but for an API created with existing service, the service is a  virtual service rather than acting as a proxy so there is no next hop.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13008</span></p>
  <h5>NPE in  Upgrade CM Models while updating VS configuration for service implementations</h5>
  <p>In some cases, the post-install  task, Upgrade CM Models, was returning a Null Pointer Exception when updating  the virtual service configuration for service implementations in version 8.2.  It was failing to load the virtual service configuration for the service key. <br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13008 </span></p>
  <h5>After  cloning an API that included a process, no process found in the cloned API</h5>
  <p>When an API included a process and the API was cloned, after  cloning, the API was generating the following error, even though in the user  interface the process appeared to be there:</p>
  <pre class="code">No process found for [postorder] operation of service </pre>
  <p class="supID">SUP-14390</p>
  <h5>CORS  response headers being removed for pre-flight messages</h5>
  <p>In version 8.2, CORS response  headers were not being returned when the client made an OPTIONS call.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13094</span></p>
  <h5>Null  Pointer Exception with using SAML assertion with resource owner grant</h5>
  <p>When a client uses the resource owner grant type to retrieve an  access token from the OAuth server, but includes a SAML assertion instead of a  username and password, the server reports a null pointer exception. This is an  illegal combination, so returning an error is appropriate, but the error  handling has been improved.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13030</span></p>
  <h5>In version  8.2.4, Invite New Users link returns error and fails</h5>
  <p>In 8.2.4, the link on the top navigation bar to invite new users  was failing and returning an error.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13360, SUP-13413, SUP-13294</span></p>
  <h5>In imported  RAML file, cannot edit parameters for POST operations</h5>
  <p>If an API was created by importing a RAML API description  document, parameters for POST operations could not be edited. <br>
    Parameters for other types of operations could be edited, and new  parameters could be added, but imported parameters for POST operations could  not be edited. Instead, an error was generated.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13423</span></p>
  <h5>Returning  app transaction logs request times out with large data volumes</h5>
  <p>With large volumes of data, a request for the app transaction  logs was timing out.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13081</span></p>
  <h5>OAuth  Provider Domain setup: special characters not allowed in OAuth scopes</h5>
  <p>When setting up the OAuth Provider Domain, in the Scopes tab,  special characters were not allowed in the scope names. Only numbers and  letters were allowed.<br>
    This has been modified to allow the special characters supported  by the OAuth specification.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13435</span></p>
  <h5>CSRF  causing issues when more than one browser tab is open</h5>
  <p>In certain scenarios, an error was generated when more than one  browser tab was open. If the user attempted to perform certain actions such as  modifying an API, the following error was generated:</p>
  <pre class="code">Caused by: javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: Failed to  authenticate the 

user at  com.soa.restapi.auz.aop.CsrfAuthenticationAdviceImpl.validateToken(CsrfAuthenticationAdviceImpl.java:478)</pre>
