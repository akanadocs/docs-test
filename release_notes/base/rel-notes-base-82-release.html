<h4>Bug fixes: 8.2.35</h4>
<div class="ATMO-25799">
<h5><a name="Forexpiredtokens%2Cstatuscode500returnedinsteadof401"></a>For expired tokens, status code 500 returned instead of 401</h5>

<p>When signing and encrypting a JWT Token that had expired, a generic HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) status code was returned to the user for an External OAuth Provider domain. If the OAuth Provider domain was used, an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code was returned. This has been fixed so that HTTP 401 is returned for expired tokens for External OAuth Provider domains.</p><p class="supID"><b>Support ticket: </b>SUPPORT-3880</p>
</div>

<div class="ATMO-25661">
<h5><a name="NetworkDirector%3APipelinepolicyerror"></a>Network Director: Pipeline policy error</h5>

<p>Because of a potential race condition under load, the Pipeline policy insert credentials component could fail with an error indicating that the SAML signature node could not be found in the SAML assertion. Under certain circumstances, this condition could result in permanent corruption of the SAML token until the next restart.</p><p class="supID"><b>Support ticket: </b>SUP-17490, SUPPORT-2120</p>

<div class="ATMO-25318">
<h5><a name="PolicyManager%3AIncorrecttimezoneanddaterangewhencustomAPIparametersareused"></a>Policy Manager: Incorrect timezone and date range when custom API parameters are used</h5>

<p>When specifying a custom date range, the date range was incorrect and based on the wrong timezone, so requests would return data from the incorrect time period. Now, the timezone is not submitted as part of the request, and the entered date range is converted to UTC time, fixing this issue.</p><p class="supID"><b>Support ticket: </b>SUP-16261</p>
</div>

<div class="ATMO-25141">
<h5><a name="ProcessEditor%3ATransformationActivitycreatingnormalizedmessages"></a>Process Editor: Transformation Activity creating normalized messages</h5>

<p>In the Process Editor, the Transformation Activity was incorrectly creating a normalized message. Because the message was normalized, the SOAP envelope was re-added to the message, with the result that the downstream service could not read the request and the request failed. This was a regression from a fix in 8.2.27; any 8.2 versions prior to 8.2.27 should work as expected.</p>

<h4>Enhancements: 8.2.33</h4>
<div class="ATMO-25041">
<h5><a name="NewheaderconnectionpropertysupportsservicelevelmultivaluedheadersinaWSDL"></a>New header connection property supports service-level multi-valued headers in a WSDL</h5>

<p>HTTP headers can now be configured as multi-valued in the API descriptor WSDL. This forces a parse of the header value before it is passed to the downstream service in order to send each part as an individual value, normalizing the values and removing unnecessary spaces in certain cases.</p>

<p>Because this behavior is not always required or desirable, a new connection property <tt>http.multi.valued.headers</tt> allows multi-valued headers to be configured on a service basis rather than globally for the container, thus avoiding the parse operation when it is not required.</p>

<p>To use this new property, add it to the WSDL within the port element. For example:</p>

  <h4>Bug Fixes: 8.2.31  </h4>
  <h5>Algorithm  is not being verified on the inbound request </h5>
  <p>For security policies configured with a  specific algorithm suite, the default behavior of the policy enforcement  handlers is to allow sending requests that use a different algorithm suite  without returning an error. In order to support validation of algorithms while  retaining backwards compatibility, a new configuration property, <strong>com.soa.wssecurity -&gt;  validate.algorithms</strong>, has been introduced. By default, this is set to <strong>false</strong>. When <strong>true</strong>, the WS-Security policy handler will validate that the  algorithms used for signatures and encryption match the configured algorithm  suite.<br>

  <h5>JMS Proxy IssueâLost messages</h5>
  <p>The default and legacy behavior of thesupID-from-word" JMS transport is to use  Auto Acknowledge for incoming messages. Because of this, messages could be  acknowledged, and removed from the incoming destination, but still fail to be  forwarded to the target service, resulting in message loss.supID-from-word"<br>
    The ability to configure the acknowledgement mode has now been  added (<strong>com.soa.jms</strong> &gt; <strong>session.factory.defaultAckMode</strong>). When  the Ack mode is set to <strong>client  acknowledge</strong>, incoming messages are only acknowledged when they have been  successfully forwarded to the downstream service.<br>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: The way that the  developer portal treats cyclic references was modified in an earlier fix for  version 8.2.17 (see <a href="#addapiswagger">Add API from Swagger document</a>: objects of type Entity do not expand  correctly).

  <h5 id="uniquecombovirtualhost">New setting for unique combination of virtual host  and context path</h5>
  <p>In version 8.0, it was possible to publish multiple APIs with the  same context path; for example, to have just a backslash (/) as the context  path.<br>
    However, in a later version, a validation check for unique  combination of virtual host and context path was added. In some cases, this  caused the API path to be automatically modified so that it was unique. Some  instances that had multiple APIs with a backslash as the context path were  affected by this.<br>
    Version 8.2.24 includes a new API setting, <strong>Validate that API context path is unique</strong>. By default, this setting  is enabled, so that unique combination of virtual host and context path is  validated. However, the Site Admin can modify the setting so that different  APIs can have the same combination of virtual host and context path. This gives  the tenant the flexibility to keep the validation check for unique path (the  default), or to disable it.<br>

  <h5>Platform JWT tokens do not follow RFC 7519 with regard to expiration</h5>
  <p>In some scenarios, JSON Web Tokens (JWT tokens) were expiring  after a short period of time whereas, per the settings, they should be valid  for some days. In addition, where messages were processed by multiple  deployment zones, in some cases there were differences in the validity period,  resulting in a token being rejected as expired and then, a little later on,  being accepted as valid by another deployment zone.<br>
    This was because the platform&rsquo;s implementation of JWT tokens was  not validating time correctly, taking into consideration future time and  clockSkew value. The platform was using a default time of 20 minutes as the  default for IAT (issuedAt) claim expiration, rather than calculating the  expected time based on the issuedAt and clockSkew properties.<br>

  <h5>Multiple service errors in log file: &ldquo;No key found in WSDL for service&rdquo;</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where an implementation of the Akana API Platform  included multiple Network Directors, with services distributed across Network  Directors rather than all hosted on all Network Directors, specific errors were  populating the log file. For services hosted on one Network Director but not on  a second, errors were generated to the log file for the second Network Director  instance, with the message:</p>
  <p class="code"> No key found in WSDL for service {service_name} </p>
  <p>The services can be retrieved, but do not have an address or  service key element when the WDSL is retrieved by the Network Director, since  the service is not hosted on that specific container.<br>
    The platform has been changed so that these messages are  recorded as warnings rather than as errors.<br>

  <h5>Possible denial of service vulnerability due to user avatar size parameter</h5>
  <p>The platform supports uploading of an image for several resources  including users, apps, APIs, and groups. There was no file size restriction in the upload API; in  addition, the processing time compounded when larger size values were provided. By using this API with a large size parameter, potentially in  multiple instances, it could be possible for an attacker to overload the  back-end processing and cause service outages.<br>
    These operations have now been changed so that the maximum file  upload size is a 1000-pixel square.<br>

  <h5>Error in conversion from string to FDN</h5>
  <p>There was a bug in the conversion of a string to an FDN (fully  distinguished name; for example, {uniqueid}.{FedMemberID}. In scenarios where  there were multiple dots in the string, the first dot was identified as the  separator, resulting in an invalid FedMemberID if there were multiple dots in  the string. For example, a string of abc.def.fedmember was converted so that  the FedMemberID would be def.fedmember.<br>
    This has been modified so that the string after the last dot is  used as the FedMemberID.<br>

  <h5>When registered users have permission to add API, registered user who is  not an API Admin can approve his or her own API access request</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where the platform defaults had been modified to  allow registered users the ability to add an API, a registered user who  requested access to an API was able to authorize the API access request even  though the user was not an API Admin for the API. This has now been fixed. Only  a Business Admin or an API Admin for the applicable API can approve an API  access request.<br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: By default,  registered users do not have permission to add an API. This issue occurred only  when the default user permissions were modified.<br>

  <h5>Truncated policy/key names resulting in duplicate names</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where an imported WSDL included policy/key names  longer than the allowable 128 characters, the names were being truncated,  resulting in duplicate policy/key names.<br>
    The platform has now been modified to generate an error if  truncation results in duplicate policy/key names.<br>

  <h5>Search not updating visibility correctly</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where an API was imported with a specific  visibility, the visibility was changed, and the API was then deleted and  re-imported, the Search feature was using the revised visibility setting for  the initial import, rather than the setting for the re-imported API.<br>
    This was caused by a delay in queuing the API for reindexing. The <strong>Edit API Details</strong> feature has now  been modified to immediately queue modified objects for indexing. Note there  might still be a short delay before a queued object is picked up for search  indexing.<br>

  <p>In a scenario where a SOAP API needed to be changed in Policy  Manager, a CSRF error was generated.

  <h5>On import, generated access point is lost</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where a service was created with multiple access  points (one default access point that was automatically generated, and an  additional access point that was manually created), there was an issue with  export/import. When the information was exported from one installation and then  imported to a second installation, the manually created access point was  present but the automatically-created access point was lost.<br>

  <h5>When adding an API, user should be able to define API deployments</h5>
  <p>When adding an API to the API Platform, the platform  automatically deploys the API on all eligible deployment zones.<br>
    The operation for adding an API allows the user to specify  information about the deployment zones they want to deploy the API on, but this  information was ignored. The code has now been changed to process the user&rsquo;s  deployment zone specifications.<br>
    If no deployment zones are specified in the API request, the  platform deploys the API on all eligible deployment zones. However, if one or  more deployment zones are specified in the request, the API is implemented only  on the specified deployment zones.<br>
    Note that this functionality is currently supported only in the  API.<br>

  <h3 id="827">Version 8.2.7</h3>
  <h4>Enhancements: 8.2.7</h4>
  <h5>Ability to support multiple OAuth scopes using an OR</h5>
  <p>Previously, the platform&rsquo;s OAuth support included support for  multiple scopes for an operation, but all scopes had to be present in the  access token (&ldquo;AND&rdquo; scenario). Now, this feature has been enhanced to support a  scenario where multiple scopes are defined for an operation but only one scope  is required in the access token in order for the request to be successful (&ldquo;OR&rdquo;  scenario).<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13062</span></p>
  <h5>Support for PingFederate 8.1.x</h5>

    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13020</span></p>
  <h4>Bug Fixes: 8.2.7</h4>
  <h5>In imported RAML file, cannot edit parameters for POST operations</h5>
  <p>If an API was created by importing a RAML API description  document, parameters for POST operations could not be edited. <br>
    Parameters for other types of operations could be edited, and new  parameters could be added, but imported parameters for POST operations could  not be edited. Instead, an error was generated.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-13423</span></p>
  <h5>PingFederate Domain: incorrect lookup for Client Registration URL returns  exception when not found</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where the domain type was the legacy PingFederate  domain and the Client Registration endpoint was not enabled, the platform was  looking for the Client Registration URL, which it should not in this scenario,  and was returning an exception because it was not found. It should only look up  the Client Registration URL if the domain type is External OAuth Provider and  the Provider type is PingFederate. This has been fixed so that if the Client  Registration URL is not defined in the well-known configuration file, the  platform treats it as though client registration is disabled.<br>

  <h5>Test Client: Custom header added in Parameters section of API Designer does  not display correctly</h5>

    <li>The platform now supports AMQPS for physical  services. </li>
    <li>Platform support of AMQP was expanded to include  support of virtual hosts without a leading forward slash (/) in the virtual  host name.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, these issues with AMQP support were resolved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Default AMQP exchange should be blank and left  to the broker.</li>
    <li>When creating AMQP messages with non-string  message parts the wrong content was sent. </li>
    <li>With a proxy API implementation, if the physical  service had an AMQP endpoint the implementations were not loading.</li>

  <h5>Search for an API with a leading hyphen returns all APIs</h5>
  <p>In the platform&rsquo;s search tool, a search for an API with a  leading hyphen in the API name returned all APIs. This is due to the fact that  the hyphen is a reserved character in the search engine. The reserved  characters are:<br>
    <strong>+ - = &amp;&amp; || &gt;  &lt; ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ &quot; ~ * ? : \ /</strong><br>
    Users searching for text that includes special characters must  escape the characters. For example, to search for (123)app, you'd have to  search for the following: <strong>\(123\)app</strong>.<br>
    When naming platform resources such as apps and APIs, it's best  to steer clear of special characters. When searching for resources, escaping  the special characters ensures the expected results.<br>

  <h5>Notifications include links to help content that has been moved</h5>
  <p>Although the embedded platform content was removed in an earlier  version, and replaced with a link to the same content on the Akana docs site (<a href="http://docs.akana.com">http://docs.akana.com</a>), certain platform  notifications that included links to specific help content pages were not  updated. This resulted in broken links in the notifications; for example, the  notification sent to a developer when API access is approved.<br>
    These notifications have now been updated to link to the  applicable content on the Akana docs site.<br>

  <h5>Swagger 1.2 files not processed correctly when uploaded as a ZIP</h5>
  <p>If Swagger 1.2 document description files were uploaded as a ZIP,  rather than as separate files, the API platform was generating an error  relating to an incorrect or missing Dropbox ID. This has now been fixed so that  Swagger 1.2 API description documents, along with other supported types, can be  uploaded either as a ZIP or as individual files.<br>

  <h5>Default random context path suffix not generated for new  APIs/Implementations</h5>
  <p>By default, the platform used to generate a random context path  for new APIs if the random prefix setting was turned off. This is necessary so  that multiple implementations for the same API do not have duplicate  hostname/context path. A regression was introduced resulting in the random  suffix not being generated; this has now been fixed.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-18224 </span></p>
  <h5>Issues with import of API description documents</h5>
  <p>In certain scenarios where Swagger 1.2 API description documents  were part of an uploaded ZIP file, the platform was not displaying a list of  services to the user and allowing the user to specify which service to use.  Instead, it was creating the service automatically or displaying the service  selection twice. In addition, in some scenarios, if there was only one file or  service in the ZIP, instead of going ahead and creating the API from that one  file/service, the platform was waiting for user input.<br>
    The correct behavior has now been restored so that if the ZIP  file includes multiple services, the user is presented with a list of services  to choose from. If there is only one service, the platform creates the API  based on that service.<br>
    There are several possibilities with regard to ZIP file  upload:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The ZIP  file includes only one file with multiple services</strong>: When the user selects  the file, the platform displays the services in the file so the user can choose  one.</li>
    <li><strong>The ZIP  file includes a single file with a single service</strong>: the platform creates the  API based on that service.</li>
    <li><strong>The ZIP  file includes multiple files</strong>: First, the user selects a file. Then, the  platform displays the available services so the user can choose one.</li>

  <h5>2FA email notifications are now sent immediately</h5>
  <p>In previous versions, email notifications for two-factor  authentication (2FA) codes were being queued, along with other types of  notifications, by a scheduled job that ran once per minute.<br>
    Because these notifications are part of the user login process,  this has now been modified so that 2FA notifications are sent immediately.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-15626</span></p>
  <h5>Integrated Process Editor in developer portal</h5>
  <p>The Developer Portal now includes an integrated Process Editor,  available via the Implementations page for an API. The API Admin can click  through from a specific operation to the Process Editor to specify  orchestration elements and other defaults for the operation such as invoking another  operation, managing input/output parameters, defining a fault sequence,  executing a script at a specific point in the process, or splitting the process  into two or more concurrent flows and then later re-joining.<br>
    Full functionality of the Process Editor, previously available  only in Policy Manager, is now accessible from the developer portal. On leaving  the Process Editor, the user is returned to the Implementations page for the  API.<br>

  <h5>New &ldquo;Hermosa&rdquo; beta theme </h5>
  <p>The developer portal  user interface has been completely redesigned with a new &ldquo;theme&rdquo; (design) with  new page layout, fonts, colors, and other aspects of user interface design.<br>
    The new layout includes  features such as an expanding/collapsing sidebar to offer more space for the  visual display of the developer portal.<br>
    The new design is  customizable so that a specific instance can be branded per customer, with custom  fonts, colors, icons, and other user interface elements.<br>
    Branding elements can be  inherited from Default Theme, or Hermosa theme can be branded independently.<br>

  <h5>API Admins can choose Physical  Service as a pattern for the creation of an API</h5>
  <p>A new implementation pattern available when creating an API,  Physical Service, is now available.<br>
    This option is available when adding an API, and when adding or  editing an implementation. If the API&rsquo;s implementation pattern is <strong>Physical Service,</strong> the API  Implementation Details page shows the endpoints configured for the physical  service.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-16642</span></p>
  <h5>API Admins can choose Orchestration as a pattern for the creation of an API</h5>
  <p>The API Platform now supports creating APIs with more complex  processes. When creating an API, the API Admin can select Advanced Options and  choose a pattern of Orchestration. This supports setting up of a more complex  API implementation including the Process Editor.<br>
    ATMO-16881</p>
  <h5>Support of SNI for API implementations</h5>
  <p>The platform now supports the SNI (Server Name Indication)  protocol extension, which allows a single server to connect multiple SSL  certificates to one IP address.<br>
    This new feature allows customers to use their own certificates,  so that their clients can choose to trust the certificate for the API  implementation, which the clients recognize, rather than the certificate for  the platform.<br>
    The API Admin can specify keys and certificates per implementation,  on the HTTPS tab in the Implementations page, and can designate that the  keys/certificates be used for all incoming SSL traffic for that implementation.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17162 / ATMO-17289</span></p>
  <h5>Developer portal supports management of API keys and certificates per implementation</h5>
  <p>The developer portal user interface now allows API Admins to  upload and assign keys and certificates for the API. This includes activities  such as generating PKI keys and CSRs and importing, exporting, and deleting PKI  keys and X.509 certificates.<br>
    The primary usage of this is for SSL clients, although it is  useful in other ways, for example for WS-Security and the JOSE security policy  (JSON Object Signing and Encryption).<br>
    API Admins can manage these security settings separately for each  API implementation in the developer portal user interface (<strong>Implementation Details</strong> page &gt; <strong>Certificates</strong> section &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>).<br>

  <h5>Administrator can manage deployment zones via the developer portal</h5>
  <p>The API Platform now offers the Site Admin and Business Admin  the ability to manage deployment zones in the developer portal user interface.  This includes all activities associated with deployment zones, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding</li>
    <li>Editing</li>
    <li>Deleting</li>
    <li>Viewing information for a specific deployment  zone, including the environment/implementation associations.</li>
    <li>Adding, modifying, or deleting an association  between an environment/implementation and a specific deployment zone.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The deployment zone is based on the API Gateway; the Admin must  specify the API Gateway that's applicable for the deployment zone and specify  other values.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17459 / ATMO-17469 /  ATMO-17471 also ATMO-17438 also ATMO-17736</span></p>
  <h5>Flexibility of URL settings for Deployment Zones</h5>
  <p>The developer portal, and the underlying infrastructure of  Policy Manager, now support additional options for setting up the URL for a  deployment zone, and for the APIs that use the deployment zone.<br>
    In Policy Manager, the new settings are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AddressOverrideBehavior (allowed, not allowed, or  required) (in the API, AddressOverrideBehavior)</li>
    <li>RandomHostNameBehavior (allowed, not allowed, or  required) (in the API, RandomPrefixBehavior)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Availability of configuration options in the developer portal  is determined by the setting for the underlying API Gateway in Policy Manager.  Then, the Site Admin or Business Admin can make additional choices to determine  options available for API Admins:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If address override is allowed, the deployment  zone can be set up so that it allows the API Admin to specify a vanity hostname  for the API.</li>
    <li>If random hostname generation is allowed, the  deployment zone can be set up so that the platform appends a randomly-generated  prefix to the hostname. The API Admin must configure the DNS system for the API  so that it resolves the hostname to the hostname for the API implementation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="source">ATMO-17931, ATMO-17941, ATMO-17924</p>
  <h5>New JOSE Security Policy</h5>
  <p>The platform now includes a new policy, the JOSE Security policy  (JSON Object Signing and Encryption). This provides support for JSON signatures  and/or encryption, and is available for both RESTful and Messaging services.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-16397</span></p>
  <h5>API Documentation: Inline Test Client tag supports different options based  on Content-Type Header</h5>
  <p>The inline Test Client tag, which allows users to add Test Client  inline in their API documentation, has been enhanced to support incorporating  multiple examples in the API documentation with different Content-Type headers.<br>
    This was implemented with the addition of new configuration  options in the <strong>config.js</strong> file.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17311</span></p>
  <h5>New Akana Administration Console settings for Elasticsearch feature</h5>
  <p>Additional Akana Administration  Console settings were added to assist in configuring  the Elasticsearch search feature:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>elastic.config.index.number.of.replicas:  Allows the Administrator to configure the number of replicas (additional  copies) of the Elasticsearch index. Each replica includes a replica of each  shard, so one replica might be distributed across multiple nodes, just as the  index itself is split into shards which are distributed across nodes.</li>
    <li>elastic.config.index.number.of.shards:  a one-time setting allowing the Administrator to configure the number of shards  (splits) for the Elasticsearch index. Note that if you change this setting, you  must then delete the /index folder that the search index is stored in and  rebuild the index.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="source">ATMO-16177</p>
  <h5>Policy Manager RESTful APIs support Basic Auth as well as SAML Bearer for  authentication</h5>

  <h5>Swagger API documentation:  multi-line field replaces single scrolling line</h5>
  <p>In earlier versions of  the platform, if the API Admin was editing Swagger API documentation, selecting  a field showed a single-line text editor that would scroll horizontally if the  text was longer than the field length.<br>
    This has now been  modified to allow a multi-line field so the API Admin can more easily see all  the content being added.<br>

  <p>In the Site Admin  section of the developer portal, the Users List previously displayed only the  user&rsquo;s signup stateâ<strong>Pending Validation</strong>, <strong>Invited</strong>, or <strong>Registered</strong>.<br>
    When the Site Admin  disabled a user in the developer portal, the user was still a registered user,  and there was no visual cue to indicate that the user was currently disabled.<br>
    An additional visual cue  has been added to indicate the user&rsquo;s current stateâ<strong>Enabled</strong>, <strong>Disabled</strong>, or <strong>Locked</strong>.<br>

  <h5>Database change to accommodate  longer hostnames</h5>
  <p>In a certain scenario,  there was an issue with a long hostname exceeding the size of the database  table and therefore not being supported. The size of the applicable database  column has now been increased to accommodate longer hostnames.<br>

  <h5>Users accessing a specific page,  then redirected to login and authenticated via SSO login, are now redirected to  the specific page after authentication</h5>
  <p>In scenarios where the  user was using SSO login to log in via a third-party authentication provider  (for example, via OpenID Connect, SAML, or SiteMinder), if the user tried to  access a specific URL and then was redirected to the SSO login page for  authentication, the platform was not redirecting the user back to the original  URL once authentication was complete.<br>
    This  has now been fixed so that if a user is attempting to access a specific page,  the user is redirected to that page after logging in.<br>

  <h5>CM container cannot use outbound container  certificate when custom workflow function makes an HTTPS request requiring  2-way SSL</h5>
  <p>In scenarios where a  custom workflow function was making an HTTPS request, requiring 2-way SSL, the  container for the developer portal was not able to use the outbound container  certificate. This has been fixed.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10484</span></p>
  <h5>Easier site customization for custom  fonts</h5>
  <p>The approach to  developer portal font customization has been redesigned to make customization  much easier.<br>

  <h5>Permit redirect URI starting with  myappschema://</h5>
  <p>Previously, the  developer portal only supported redirect URI formats beginning with <strong>http://</strong> or <strong>https://</strong>.<br>
    Now, the platform also  supports <strong>myappschema://</strong>.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10343</span></p>
  <h5>OAuth auth tokens: refactoring of  scheduled job, refactoring of database storage</h5>
  <p>The platform includes  two changes to improve efficiency in the handling of OAuth auth tokens:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Change to scheduled job for deleting expired  auth tokens</li>
    <li>Change to database storage of auth tokens</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Change to scheduled job for deleting  expired auth tokens</strong><br>
    The scheduled job that  includes the action of deleting expired OAuth Provider auth tokens was running  once per minute on every container with the OAuth Provider feature installed.  This meant that there might be multiple DELETE queries running on the same  table, possibly running concurrently. The scheduled job ran every five minutes.<br>
    This has now been  refactored so that deletion of expired OAuth Provider auth tokens is a separate  scheduled job, and only one instance runs at any time. The new scheduled job  runs every hour, persistently.<br>
    <strong>Change to database storage of auth tokens</strong><br>
    On the OAUTH_AUTH_TOKENS  table, a new column was added, <strong>TOKEN_VALUE2</strong>,  with varchar length 4000. This new column works together with the existing <strong>TOKENVALUE</strong> column for storage of OAuth  auth tokens.<br>
    If the token is less  than 4000 characters, it is stored in the new column with a data type of  varchar. Tokens longer than 4000 characters are stored in the existing column  with a data type of CLOB. This is more efficient use of database storage space.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10908</span></p>
  <h5>Map display for deployment zones  now accommodates scenario of no geolocation specified</h5>
  <p>The Deployment Zone is  based on the underlying API Gateway which normally, but not always, has a  geolocation specified.<br>
    The logic associated  with the map has been improved to accommodate a scenario where there is no  geolocation specified for the deployment zone. In the past, if the location  wasn&rsquo;t specified for a container, default values were used. Now, the map  displays &ldquo;Location Unknown&rdquo; and displays the indicator for the deployment zone  in the top left section of the map.<br>

    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-5702</span></p>
  <h5>Tenant Manager API now supports MongoDB for statistics reporting</h5>
  <p>The tenant usage statistics were only supporting the use of the  RDBMS for reading metrics. The API has now been changed to also support MongoDB  when the system is configured to use MongoDB for storing metrics.<br>

  <h5>New API operations to get and save proxied endpoints</h5>
  <p>Two new operations were added to get and save proxied  endpoints for an API:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>GET&nbsp;/api/apis/versions/{ApiVersionID}/implementations/{ImplCode}/services/{ServiceID}/endpoints</li>

  <h5>When editing an existing API using SOAP option, available Target URL is  duplicated</h5>
  <p>If a user added an API using a SOAP WSDL URL, with one target  option, and then edited the API, the target URL was duplicated for the edited  API. This has been fixed.<br>

  <h5>Outgoing SSL sockets do not account for routing configuration</h5>
  <p>After routing was applied, outgoing HTTPS connections were not  using the actual endpoint selected. This has been fixed.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-16569</span></p>
  <h5>Schemas defined in imported RAML not showing in UI</h5>
  <p>In the developer portal, if a user imported a RAML file that  included referenced schemas in the same file, the referenced schemas were not  displayed in the user interface (API Designer &gt; Models section).<br>
    This has now been fixed so that schemas referenced in the same  file are correctly imported and displayed.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-16725</span></p>
  <h5>Import DL and Add API with Service should check for API Settings and take  user to &ldquo;Feature Disabled&rdquo; page</h5>
  <p>The platform&rsquo;s Add API feature was not checking the platform&rsquo;s  API Settings, and was allowing users to add an API with service, or by importing  an API description document, when the setting that allows users to add an API  was turned off. This has now been fixed. If a user attempts to add an API and  the feature is disabled, the user is redirected to a Feature Disabled page.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-16872 for 8.2 only</span></p>
  <h5>Improve tags grouping when there are tags at operation level but not at  root level</h5>
  <p>The Swagger specification supports assigning one or more tags to  one or more operations within an API. Tags can be applied at the root level, to  all operations, or at the operation level, to one or more operations.<br>
    In version 8.1, the API details page was displaying a list of  resources grouped by tag, and also including a grouping for All Operations,  causing unnecessary redundancy in the display.<br>
    Version 8.2 includes the following changes to the way tags are  treated:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The grouping for All Operations has been  removed.</li>
    <li>If operations are not tagged, the server assigns  a tag that is the same as the API name.</li>
    <li>If one operation has multiple tags, the same  operation is displayed under each of the tags. </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="source">ATMO-16918 for 8.2 </p>
  <h5>App Details page shows Connected APIs twice, and API Details page shows  Connected Apps twice, if connected with two implementations</h5>
  <p>If an app was connected to an API in two environments, the app  was listed twice in the Connected Apps section of the API Details page, and in  the same way, the API was listed twice in the Connected APIs section of the App  Details page.<br>
    This has been fixed so that a connected app/API shows up only  once, even if there are two connections for the same app and API.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17008 for 8.1.1 / ATMO-16935  for 8.2</span></p>
  <h5>Realtime charts not updating</h5>
  <p>In a specific scenario, realtime charts were not updating. The  total response time was greater than the maximum value allowed in the database.  The data type of the database column has now been changed to Long in order to  accommodate greater values.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-5759</span></p>
  <h5>Deleting an app/client does not delete associated OAuth grants</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where an OAuth grant was issued in Test Client, and  the app was then deleted, the grant was still valid and could be used for API  requests. This has now been fixed so that if an app is deleted the remaining  OAuth grants for the app are no longer valid.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10011, SUP-10103</span></p>
  <h5>On Dashboard notifications, date does not display correctly</h5>
  <p>In version 8.1, there was an error in the date display for  notifications on the user Dashboard. Instead of the correct date/timestamp, the  date was displayed as &ldquo;Invalid Date.&rdquo; This has been fixed.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10667 / SUP-10317</span></p>
  <h5>API admin unable to edit implementation</h5>

  <h5>When more than one container is running scheduled jobs, lock wait timeout  on rollup jobs</h5>
  <p>In scenarios where scheduled jobs were running on multiple  containers, the 15-minute rollup jobs were continually throwing &ldquo;lock wait  timeout exceeded&rdquo; errors. This has been fixed.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-16986 for 8.1.1 / ATMO-17016  for 8.2</span></p>
  <h5>In apis/findAPIImplementations, response object shows Implementation in  Pattern field</h5>
  <p>The GET /api/apis/versions/implementations operation returns  information about all implementations.<br>
    In the response, this operation was returning implementation type  (Live or Sandbox) rather than the implementation pattern (for example,  com.akana.pattern.proxy). This has been fixed.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17017</span></p>
  <h5>customLoginPage does not redirect user to a  non-default landing page after login</h5>
  <p>The platform supports the ability to modify the default behavior  and redirect users to a different page after login. However, a later change  relating to the introduction of another feature caused a regression in this  feature. This has now been fixed so that this functionality again works. Users  can write a custom <strong>custom_en-us.json</strong> file, specifying that after login users are redirected to a different page, and  upload the custom file to the resources/theme/{themename}/locales folder.<br>
    After clearing cache and refreshing the browser, the revised  behavior takes effect immediately.<br>

  <h5>When there are many users, users list becomes unresponsive</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where a customer had a large number of users, more  than 1500, the user interface was loading all the information, and did not  allow actions to be taken on users that had been loaded; then, it became  unresponsive.<br>
    This page has now been re-engineered for much greater  responsiveness and efficiency in how it treats large numbers of users. Actions  can be taken on users displayed on the page, and subsequent pages are loaded when  the user scrolls down to the end of the page. <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17062 /ATMO-17206 / SUP-10725  {{OK J</span><br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10725</span></p>
  <h5>API Admin Group Membership Workflow Definition ID is reset if API settings  are changed</h5>
  <p>The platform includes a configuration parameter to determine the  workflow definition to use for API Admin Group memberships. Currently, this  property can only be set in the database, not in the user interface. In the  database, the property is in the BUSINESS_API_SETTINGS table,  APIADMINMEMWFDEFID column.<br>
    If this field was manually set in the database, and a user then  changed the API settings in the user interface, the manual setting was being  erased. This has now been fixed so that existing values are not affected by  updates to other properties.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-8170</span></p>
  <h5>SaaS platform: Resolve issues with rollup statistics</h5>
  <p>On the SaaS platform, for historical charts, the queries were  timing out with MongoDB. In addition, with MySQL, the organizational rollups  were incorrect. These issues have been fixed.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17106</span></p>
  <h5>OAuth Agent: fix to two ResourceServerAPI issues</h5>
  <p>Two API issues relating to OAuth were fixed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>UserInfoAPI gave null pointer exception if the serviceQName  was not available</li>
    <li>OAuthProviderName parameter was not correctly  annotated.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="source">ATMO-17126</p>
  <h5>With integrated Test Client in authored API documentation, OAuth token is  failing with 3-legged grant types</h5>
  <p>In scenarios where the integrated Test Client feature was used to  integrate Test Client into authored API documentation using the <strong>config.js</strong> file and the <strong>soa:testclient</strong> tag, and the OAuth  security policy was assigned to the API, there was an issue with obtaining the  OAuth token if the user selected a three-legged OAuth grant type. The developer  portal UI was using the wrong redirect URL, so the OAuth token was not  correctly returned to the user interface. This has now been fixed.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17218 for 8.0.3 / ATMO-17137  for 8.2</span></p>
  <h5>User with only ApiAdmin role is getting Unauthorized page when accessing  target endpoints link on a proxy API</h5>
  <p>In version 8.1, users who had only the API Admin role, not  Business Admin or Site Admin, were getting an Unauthorized message if the API  was proxied and the user attempted to access the target endpoints (<strong>Implementations</strong> &gt; specific  implementation &gt; <strong>Modify Target  Endpoints</strong> link). This has been fixed.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17204</span></p>
  <h5>Simple Dev theme: API Test Client tag not displaying correct config  parameters</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where API documentation was using an uploaded <strong>config.js</strong> file to control the display  of the API in Test Client, certain config parameters were being ignored when  the API documentation was displayed in Simple Dev theme. This has been fixed.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17232</span></p>
  <h5>App &gt; APIs page, Request Production Access link is missing</h5>
  <p>In version 8.1.1, in a scenario where an app had a contract with  an API in the Sandbox environment but not in the Production environment, the  Request Production Access link was not available. This has been fixed.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10982</span></p>
  <h5>Search by email ID is case-sensitive</h5>
  <p>In version 8.0, the search on the Users List was case-sensitive.  This meant that if the search did not have the exact case that had been set up  for the email address, a match was not found. This has been fixed so that email  search is performed regardless of case.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11006</span></p>
  <h5>TestClient issue with SOAP services: header is now set to SOAP default  values with message</h5>
  <p>If the API was created by uploading a WSDL file, and the user  then selects the SOAP endpoints in Test Client, the Content-Type and Accept  headers are now set for the SOAP endpoint, as specified in the API definition.<br>
    In the generated API documentation for a SOAP API, a message is  displayed to let the user know that Swagger is not supported for a SOAP API.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10841</span></p>
  <h5>Search result for registered user links to landing page</h5>
  <p>If a Site Admin or Business Admin searched for a registered user  using the Search feature, the search results were linking to the landing page.  This has been fixed so that the search results link to the user&rsquo;s profile.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-3858 / KNR-761400 </span></p>
  <h5>On SaaS, in some cases, updating an API creates an anonymous contract</h5>

  <h5>When a user has more than 1000 apps, the My Apps page fails with Oracle  database</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where a user had a very large number of apps, more  than 1000, the My Apps page was failing if the database was Oracle. This  functionality has now been refactored to work with all databases.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-16526</span></p>
  <h5>API Designer changes data type &ldquo;number&rdquo; to &ldquo;integer&rdquo;</h5>
  <p>In the API designer, when defining a response, on the Swagger  tab, if the user specified a data type of Number and then saved, the data type  was changed to Integer. This has been fixed.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-16942</span></p>
  <h5>When editing an API, Save button is sometimes disabled</h5>
  <p>In some cases, after an API was created in the developer portal,  when the user tried to edit the API, the Save button was disabled. This has  been fixed.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10642</span></p>
  <h5>Simple Dev theme: relative links not working as expected</h5>
  <p>With uploaded documentation files in Simple Dev theme, relative  links were not working as expected. Users could click into a different file at  the top navigation level, but not to another relative link within a file. The  folder name was added to the URL, giving unexpected results. This has been  fixed.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10636</span></p>
  <h5>When Swagger file doesn&rsquo;t include operation-level tags or root-level tags,  inconsistent display in API Designer/API documentation</h5>
  <p>In scenarios where the Swagger file for an API did not include  tags, at the operation level or at the root level, there were inconsistencies  in the way the operations were displayed between the API Designer view and the  API documentation view.<br>
    Now, in scenarios where there are no tags defined in the Swagger  file, &ldquo;default&rdquo; is used consistently in both locations.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17200 for 8.2 also ATMO-17386</span></p>
  <h5>Add API with Swagger YAML document: API Designer shows the schema for a  POST request but API Details and generated documentation do not</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where an API was added in the developer portal  using a Swagger YAML document, the API Designer showed the POST request  content, but the API Details and generated API documentation did not show the  content. That area was blank.<br>
    This has been fixed so that the request content is displayed  correctly in all places.<br>

  <h5>Editing endpoints in deployment zones not working as expected</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where a deployment zone endpoint had both HTTP and  HTTPS endpoints, if one of the endpoints was deleted, the developer portal was  only allowing addition of an endpoint with the same protocol as the remaining  endpoint. So, for example, for HTTP and HTTPS endpoints, after deletion of the  HTTPS endpoint, only another HTTP endpoint could be added.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10863</span></p>
  <h5>File Explorer for API documentation: viewing parent folder gives error</h5>
  <p>In API &gt; Documents, if the API Admin clicked the File Explorer  icon, navigating to the parent folder generated an error.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10771</span></p>
  <h5>When editing an API, the endpoint in the virtual service changes</h5>
  <p>If an API was edited, the container that the virtual service is  hosted on was changing. In some cases this caused confusion when a developer  edited an API to attach a policy or add a new operation.<br>
    Example scenario: four clusters, each with one listener, API  hosted on second cluster. When the API was edited, the API was then hosted on  the first cluster, and the endpoint changed. The user needed to change the  deployment zone drop-down, and could easily miss this step.<br>
    This issue has been fixed so that when the user saves the change,  the correct URL is selected.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">PQW-890300, SUP-8232, SUP-8323</span></p>
  <h5>Edit API: In a specific scenario, &ldquo;Sync to proxy&rdquo; button not working</h5>
  <p>In the Edit API wizard, Target page, in a scenario where the API  was using a specific default media type profile, the <strong>Sync to Proxy</strong> button was not working.<br>
    This occurred if the API Default profile was set to an option <em>other than</em> <strong>Any in and out</strong> or <strong>Custom in  and out</strong> (for example, <strong>JSON in and  out</strong>). This issue has been fixed.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10649</span></p>
  <h5>API Designer: Add response detail for Swagger documentation</h5>
  <p>The API Designer now supports expanding the response data type to  show details of the response model object.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10998</span></p>
  <h5>Response array schema not saved when API is created by importing a Swagger  JSON file or when API is edited</h5>

  <h5>Users accessing a specific page, then redirected to login and authenticated  via SSO login, should be redirected to the specific page after authentication</h5>
  <p>In scenarios where the user was using SSO login to log in via a  third-party authentication provider (for example, via OpenID Connect, SAML, or  SiteMinder), if the user tried to access a specific URL and then was redirected  to the SSO login page for authentication, the platform was not redirecting the  user back to the original URL once authentication was complete.<br>
    This has now been fixed so that if a user is attempting to access  a specific page, the user is redirected to that page after logging in.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-8263</span></p>
  <h5>Uploaded HTML content file was deleted, but still shows in the search index</h5>

    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11020</span></p>
  <h5>Elasticsearch: Initialization errors not reported in the logs</h5>
  <p>With Elasticsearch running in embedded mode, in scenarios where  indexing was failing when Elasticsearch was not initialized, errors were not  showing up in the logs. Initialization occurs at the start of the node itself,  and the indexing was assuming availability of the Elasticsearch client node.<br>
    This has been fixed so that if there is an Elasticsearch  initialization error it is reported in the log.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11218</span></p>
  <h5>User cannot add ClientID in PingFederate because required header is missing</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where a user was trying to add a ClientID in  PingFederate, the call was failing because the X-XSRF-Header was missing. This  header is required by PingFederate when making a Client Registration API call. This has now been fixed so that this required header is sent with  the Client Registration call.<br>

  <h5>Group Membership Workflow: Issue  with changing group member status to Admin</h5>
  <p>API groups have three membership tiers: Administrator, Leader,  and Member. A group Admin should have permission to make another user a Leader  or an Admin.<br>
    In the user interface, the <strong>Make  Admin</strong> button was displayed for a user who was an Admin for the group.  However, if the user didn&rsquo;t also have the Site Admin role, if the user clicked  the button, an error message relating to permissions was generated and the  status was not changed.<br>
    This issue was due to an error in the underlying Group Membership  Workflow. The workflow has been fixed; however, to implement the change, if  you&rsquo;re upgrading, you&rsquo;ll need to manually update your workflow and then upload  the revision (Administration &gt; Settings &gt; Groups).<br>
    Look for <strong>STEP  200-Accepted</strong> in the workflow. The conditions type was <strong>AND</strong> rather than <strong>OR</strong>.  Change it as shown below, and implement the new workflow.</p>
  <p class="code"> &lt;action id=&quot;205&quot;  name=&quot;group.membership.action.make.admin&quot;&gt;<br>
    &lt;restrict-to&gt;<br>

  <h5>Cannot log in to the Akana Admin Console with Administrator login if Local  domain is selected</h5>
  <p>When local domain was selected, users could not log in to the  Admin Console using the Administrator login. Instead, there was an  authorization error.<br>
    This has been fixed; however, note that the container must be  registered in Policy Manager for this feature to work.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-9725</span></p>
  <h5>Accessing  OAuth LDAP authorization screen causes flooding of CM logs</h5>
  <p>Accessing the LDAP authorization screen for OAuth caused an error  message that repeated continuously in the log file. This has been fixed. <br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-9859</span></p>
  <h5>API admin cannot access Monitor &gt; Logs page</h5>
  <p>In version 8.0, an API admin who was not a Business Admin or Site  Admin was not able to view the logs for the API (API &gt; Monitor &gt; Logs).  Instead, a general system error was generated.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11283, SUP-11436</span></p>
  <h5>Context path not set correctly when using suggestions to add protocol tab</h5>
  <p>The wrong calculated endpoint was being set even when the context  path was defaulted to &quot;/&quot;.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17719</span></p>
  <h5>Policy Manager: Deleting a service or container taking too long</h5>
  <p>Deleting a service or container in Policy Manager was taking more  than a minute, and in some cases deletion was not successful even after  multiple attempts.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17794</span></p>
  <h5>Forum  alerts added as a result of SLA and Throughput policies visible to all users  with visibility of the API</h5>
  <p>Forum alerts generated by the Throughput quota policy and  Concurrent Request quota policy were visible to all users who had visibility of  the API, including anonymous users if the API was public.<br>
    This has now been modified so that these alerts are visible only  to API Admins.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11277</span></p>
  <h5>Issue  with reading WSDL document when query parameter is not defined in WSDL input  parts</h5>
  <p>In some scenarios, Edit API Details was failing because of an  issue with reading the WSDL document associated with the API, when the WSDL  referenced a query parameter that did not have the corresponding WSDL input  defined. This has been fixed.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">OPD-849497 </span></p>
  <h5>API Designer: Required field error text not cleared when value is entered</h5>
  <p>In the API Designer, if the user created a response on an  operation by entering a status code but no description, and then clicked the  Swagger tab, there was a validation error. Then, if the user clicked back and  provided a value, the validation error did not clear as it should have.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-16565</span></p>
  <h5>API Designer: Once checked, &quot;Allow Empty Value&quot; check box cannot  be cleared</h5>
  <p>In the API Designer, when editing a parameter, if the user  checked the <strong>Allow Empty Value</strong> check  box, it became permanently enabled, and the user was not able to clear the  check box.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-16943</span></p>
  <h5>OAuth: Grant information is added to client information</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where a client sent a header that the platform uses  for propagating the OAuth information downstream, the platform was adding  values to the header. For example, if the client sent the oauth_client_id and  an OAuth token in the request, the platform would add the OAuth token&rsquo;s  authenticated value in the same header, as a comma-separated value.<br>
    The platform now overwrites values after validation instead,  which is more secure.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10786</span></p>
  <h5>For existing APIs, Upgrade CM Models does not create the design service if  operation name includes a forward slash</h5>
  <p>When upgrading from a previous version of the platform to 8.1,  the Upgrade CM Models post-upgrade task was not successful on earlier APIs if  the API included a forward slash in the operation name. As a result, the API  Admin could not edit the API design.<br>
    Previously, the Upgrade CM Models  task was modified to replace any spaces in operation names with an underscore  character. This task has now been updated so that it also replaces a forward  slash with an underscore.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10684</span></p>
  <h5>Simple Dev theme: API Name for sandbox URL is shown as (labels.Sandbox)</h5>
  <p>In Simple Dev theme, if an app was connected to an API with a  Sandbox endpoint, in Test Client in the API drop-down list the entry was  showing up with the environment listed as <strong>labels.Sandbox</strong> rather than <strong>Sandbox</strong>.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11206 </span></p>
  <h5>Elasticsearch: deleted documents still present in the search index</h5>
  <p>When documents were deleted, the associated entries were not  being deleted from the search index, so deleted documents were still included  in search results. <br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11335</span></p>
  <h5>External Login when user has pending agreements yields 401 Unauthorized</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where the user was logging in using an external  identity provider such as the Google Connector domain or OpenID Connect Relying  Party domain, and there was a pending agreement that the user had to accept to  complete the login, the pending agreement was not being presented to the user.  Instead, a 401 Unauthorized message was returned to the user.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11373</span></p>
  <h5>Refactoring of ApiContractSlaEvaluationJob </h5>
  <p>The ApiContractSlaEvaluationJob scheduled job was using a single  log block for the entire job. In certain scenarios, this could cause very large  log files. This job has now been refactored to use detached logging for each  SLA. <br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-5718</span></p>
  <h5>Window sizes adjusted for policies</h5>
  <p>Window sizes were adjusted so that all policy names displayed  correctly in the developer portal.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17712</span></p>
  <h5>API documentation fixes</h5>
  <p>The following fixes were made in the API documentation for the  developer portal:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>LoginAPI, ssoLogin operation: domain parameter  was incorrectly represented in initial cap (Domain). This parameter must be  lowercase.</li>
    <li>createAPI and createAPIVersion operations:  clarify which properties are supported in the request.</li>
    <li>Fix typo: /api/login/endsession represented in  one instance as /api/endsession (/api/ is missing from the path).</li>
    <li>In the <strong>ProxyImplementationRequest</strong> object, <strong>TargetEndpointURL</strong> was  represented as string rather than array of string.</li>
    <li>In Tenant Administration service, importPackage  operation was not documented.<br>
      <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11918 /  SUP-11978, SUP-11968, SUP-12098</span></li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Console Context Path affects Akana Admin Console</h5>
  <p>In the configuration settings, in <strong>com.soa.config</strong>, if the <strong>context.path</strong> property was changed, it was changing the context path for Policy Manager, but  also affected the Akana Admin Console, causing some wizards to return a 404.<br>
    This has now been fixed so that there is a new property in the <strong>com.soa.console</strong> configuration settings, <strong>pmcontext.path</strong>, that affects only  Policy Manager.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17777</span></p>
  <h5>Links to Learnmore embedded help content removed</h5>
  <p>The embedded help content on the Support page was removed, but a  link to it on the Popular Searches menu had not been removed. This was fixed.<br>
    In addition, all links anywhere in the UI to this content have  now been updated to link to the help content on the Akana docs site.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17804, ATMO-17913</span></p>
  <h5>After importing Google RAML, API Designer page does not show</h5>
  <p>In a specific scenario, creating an API by importing a RAML  document from a URL resulted in the API Designer page not being displayed at  all. This has been fixed so that the API Designer correctly shows the API  description from the RAML file.<br>
    ATMO-17826</p>
  <h5>Fresh install with Oracle 11g fails</h5>
  <p>A fresh installation with Oracle 11g database was failing on the  &ldquo;install schemas&rdquo; step, with the error &ldquo;invalid modification of columns.&rdquo;<br>
    This has been fixed, but requires running the following script  after you&rsquo;ve performed the installation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="code">ALTER TABLE OAUTH_AUTH_TOKENS ADD TEMP clob NULL; </p>
  <p class="code">update OAUTH_AUTH_TOKENS set TEMP = TOKENVALUE; </p>
  <p class="code">ALTER TABLE OAUTH_AUTH_TOKENS DROP COLUMN TOKENVALUE; </p>
  <p class="code">ALTER TABLE OAUTH_AUTH_TOKENS RENAME COLUMN TEMP TO  TOKENVALUE;</p>

  </p>
  <h5>Test Client: Regression in finding redirect URL based on the Portal URL  being accessed</h5>
  <p>In Test Client, there was a regression in version 8.0.3 with  regard to obtaining the OAuth token for API access.<br>
    The redirect URL is constructed based on the portal URL, and if  there was no port number in the URL, the redirect URL was being constructed  with an extra colon after &ldquo;host&rdquo; in the URL, as follows: <br>
    <span class="code">http://host:/path</span><br>
  </p>
  <p>Now, the platform includes the port number with colon if it  exists, and omits the colon if there is no port number.<br>
    Similarly, when building the signature base string, the platform  was not removing the port number from the URL in scenarios where the port  number was the default for the protocol (HTTP port 80, HTTPS port 443). This  resulted in the application security policy signature not working. Default port  is now removed prior to building the signature base string.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11969 / SUP-12082</span></p>
  <h5>Improved handling of Swagger path parameters when an invalid name is used</h5>
  <p>In a scenario where regular expression path parameters were  erroneously used as the parameter name in the Swagger document, the resulting  API had an additional parameter that showed up as the first path parameter: <strong>params___.___</strong>.<br>
    Treatment of path parameters has been improved so that an invalid  name is ignored and only valid parameters are represented in the API Designer.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12024</span></p>
  <h5>API Designer: support of Any type property in Swagger schema</h5>
  <p>In API Designer, in the Add/Edit Response dialog, the developer  portal was not correctly saving the data type value of <strong>Any</strong>.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17869</span></p>
  <h5>App &gt; Connections: Arrow for Actions menu for a specific contract not  displaying in Firefox</h5>
  <p>In the App &gt; Connections page, for an existing contract, the  drop-down arrow for the Actions menu was not displayed correctly in Firefox. It  worked correctly in Chrome.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12047 </span></p>
  <h5>With imported Swagger JSON file, request or response array not processed  correctly</h5>
  <p>In scenarios where an API was created from an imported Swagger  JSON file, objects in a request or response array were not being processed  correctly.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-16308</span></p>
  <h5>When API is created with swagger.json and exported as RAML, Swagger  &quot;definitions&quot; not preserved as RAML schemas</h5>
  <p>If an API was created using an imported Swagger JSON file, and  the API definition was then exported as RAML, the &ldquo;definition&rdquo; values in the  Swagger were not being preserved as schemas in the RAML file, as they should  be.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17829</span></p>
  <h5>Deployment Zone page displays listener name rather than container name</h5>
  <p>On the Deployment Zone summary page, the value displayed for the  API Gateway was the listener name, not the container name.<br>
    <span class="source-hide">ATMO-17962</span></p>
  <h5>API Editor blank after adding an API</h5>
  <p>After adding a new API, the API Editor was showing as blank.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-12199</span></p>
  <h5>When Network Director matches the request to the service operation based on  the path, it should be sensitive to locations of path parameters</h5>
  <p>Network Director has been modified to more accurately match the  request to the service operation based on the path.<br>
    For example, if a request for /a/b/c is received, all operations  listed below would match this request. If there are multiple operations  matching the request, priority must be given to the one that&rsquo;s closest to the  top of the list.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>/a/b/c</li>
    <li>/a/b/{x}</li>
    <li>/a/{x}/c</li>
    <li>/{x}/b/c</li>
    <li>/a/{x}/{y}</li>
    <li>/{x}/b/{y}</li>
    <li>/{x}/{y}/c</li>
    <li>/{x}/{y}/{z}<br>
      <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11022</span></li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Exported CSV file for API logs displays fault for non-200 HTTP status codes  in the 200 series, such as 201</h5>
  <p>If API logs are exported as CSV, the log displays a fault for  HTTP status codes in the 200 series unless the code is exactly 200. Other codes  in the 200 series, such as 201 or 202, are also success codes.<br>
    Now, 2xx is considered as a successful status code.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-9861 / SUP-9866</span></p>
  <h5>Support for APIs with large numbers of operations</h5>
  <p>There was a problem in a scenario where a tenant had a very large  number of APIs (close to 1000). This has been fixed to offer better support for  large numbers of APIs.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11933</span></p>
  <h5>Process Editor: content for Script activity is stored as Base64 encoded</h5>
  <p>In Policy Manager 8.0.6, content added as part of a Script  activity in Process Editor was being stored as Base64 encoded, making it  inaccessible to the script writer.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-11435 </span></p>
  <h5>If message conversion fails, platform now returns original fault rather  than a conversion error message</h5>
  <p>If message conversion fails, resulting in a downstream HTTP  fault, the platform was returning a conversion error. This has been modified so  that it now returns the original fault.<br>
    <span class="supID-from-word">SUP-10584</span></p>
  <h5>Add API Version UI changes</h5>
  <p>The Add API Version UI has changed so that options are more  accurately shown or hidden based on the user&rsquo;s valid choices. The Advanced  Options are not displayed to the user if the user chooses to add a new API,  whether by cloning current version, designing from scratch, or uploading an API  description document.<br>

  <h4 id="82-knownissues">Known Issues: Integration with Lifecycle Manager</h4>
  <p>If your implementation includes integration with the Lifecycle  Manager product, and you&rsquo;re using the Akana API Platform version 8.2x, there&rsquo;s  an additional step you&rsquo;ll have to take so that authorized users have full  access to APIs that were published from Lifecycle Manager.<br>
    Because of recent redesign of Community Manager affecting  permissions, users viewing APIs that were published from Lifecycle Manager  might see a system error when trying to view aspects of the API, such as the  API Implementations page. In order to see the full information, the user must  have the Organization Administrator role.<br>
    A workaround to this is to assign the role to the applicable user  in Policy Manager. You could also add the Business Administrator group using  the procedure below, so that all Business Admin users would have this  permission. </p>
  <h5>To assign the Organization Administrator role in Policy Manager</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Log in to Policy Manager and click the <strong>Workbench</strong> tab.</li>
    <li>On the left, select your organization, and then  on the right, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
    <li>Find the Organization Administrator role, as  shown below, and then click <strong>Manage Role</strong>.</li>
    <li>In the <strong>Object  Based Security Role</strong> window, locate the user or user group by choosing  settings in the search boxes; for example, choose Match Type of <strong>Contains</strong>, enter a value for the  username, specify the domain, specify Users or User Groups, and click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
    <li>Assign  the user or user group to the role and click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  </ul>
  <h4 id="preupgrade">Pre-Upgrade Task  for upgrades from 8.0.5 or earlier</h4>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re upgrading from version 8.0.5 or an earlier version,  you&rsquo;ll need to completely uninstall a specific bundle, and then remove the  OAuth folder, before proceeding with your upgrade.<br>
    Follow this procedure on all Policy Manager containers with  Community Manager, or any Community Manager add-on features, installed.<br>
    The steps are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Manually  uninstall the com.soa.oauth.interfaces bundle: see <a href="#uninstallbundle">To uninstall the com.soa.oauth.interfaces bundle</a> below.</li>
    <li>For  any version 8.0.5 or older, remove the lib/oauth/{VersionID} subfolder. If  there are subfolders for more than one version, delete any that are for version  8.0.5 or older.</li>
    <li>Stop  the container.</li>
    <li>Perform  the update (using the new platform version and, as always, making sure you  delete the configurator&rsquo;s cache folder first).</li>
    <li>Start  the container.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: For full upgrade  instructions, including steps 3â5 above, see <a href="http://docs.akana.com/ag/assets/AAP_80_82_Upgrade_Guide.pdf">http://docs.akana.com/ag/assets/AAP_80_82_Upgrade_Guide.pdf</a>.  Complete steps 1 and 2 above before following the upgrade instructions.</p>
  <h5 id="uninstallbundle">To uninstall the com.soa.oauth.interfaces bundle</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Identify  the ID of the <strong>com.soa.oauth.interfaces</strong> bundle:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Log  in to the Akana Administration Console for the container.</li>
      <li>Click  the <strong>Installed Features</strong> tab.</li>
      <li>From  the drop-down menu at the top left, choose <strong>Bundle</strong>,  as shown below.</li>
      <img src="img/system-bundle.jpg" width="135" height="65" alt=""/>
      <li>Look  for the <strong>com.soa.oauth.interfaces</strong> bundle.</li>
      <li>Note  the ID of the bundle (in the Bundle ID column).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Open  the shell or command prompt that you use to start the container.</li>
    <li>Run  the following command to uninstall the bundle:</li>
    <p class="code">uninstall  {bundleID}</p>
    <li>Repeat  Steps 1â3 for any additional containers that have Policy Manager plus any  Community Manager features installed.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once these steps are complete, proceed with the standard upgrade  process.</p>
  <h4 id="postupgrade">Post-Upgrade  Task for upgrades to 8.2.10</h4>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re upgrading from any previous version to version 8.2.10, you&rsquo;ll  need to complete the Provisioning and Upgrade CM Models tasks as part of the upgrade  process to implement the correction to the default settings for the <strong>CorsAllowAll</strong> policy.<br>
    Make sure the below steps are included in your upgrade  process:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In  the Akana Administration Console, click the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab.</li>
    <li>In  the <strong>Configuration Actions</strong> section,  choose the Provisioning configuration action. You&rsquo;ll be prompted for any input  needed to complete the provisioning step.</li>
    <li>Repeat  as needed for additional containers.</li>
    <li>Stop  and restart all containers.</li>
    <li>Complete  the Upgrade CM Models post-upgrade task:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In  the Akana Administration Console, on the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab, under <strong>Configuration Action</strong>,  choose <strong>Upgrade CM Models</strong>.</li>
      <li>When  done, click <strong>Close</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <h4 id="amqp-virtual-host">AMQP Virtual Host Reconfiguration</h4>
  <p>In 8.2.6, support for AMQP virtual hosts that did not have a  leading &lsquo;/&rsquo; was added. Unfortunately, as a result of adding this support, AMQP  virtual hosts created prior to 8.2.6 will now no longer function correctly in  the Network Director. This includes virtual hosts defined in AMQP listeners as  well as virtual hosts defined for AMQP physical services. These virtual hosts  will have to be corrected by manually reentering their values in the Policy  Manager Console. The previous values are still supported, just that they will  need to be re-saved.</p
