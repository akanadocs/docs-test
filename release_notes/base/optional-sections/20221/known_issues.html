<h5>CloudHSM external keystore feature does not require an alias password</h5>
   <p>When performing key operations using CloudHSM, no alias password is required to perform key operations because the encrypted username and password are already passed when the container is started.</p>

   <p>The result is that any password provided as part of the payload is ignored, i.e., a wrong password would not cause the operation to fail.</p>
   
<h5>The Throughput Quota policy processes an extra request with the grid counter service</h5>
   <p>When the Throughout Quota policy is configured with a limit of x requests per time interval, the throughput limit exceeded error is returned for x + two requests instead of x + one request.</p>
