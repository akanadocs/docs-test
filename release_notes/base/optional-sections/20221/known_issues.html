<h5>CloudHSM external keystore feature does not require an alias password</h5>
   <p>When performing key operations using CloudHSM, no alias password is required to perform key operations because the encrypted username and password are already passed when the container is started.</p>

   <p>The result is that any password provided as part of the payload is ignored, i.e., a wrong password would not cause the operation to fail.</p>
