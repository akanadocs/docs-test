<h4 id="i_2022.1.2">Known Issues 2022.1.2</h4>   
<h5>The Throughput Quota policy processes an extra request with the grid counter service</h5>
   <p>When the Throughout Quota policy is configured with a limit of x requests per time interval, the throughput limit exceeded error is returned for x + two requests instead of x + one request.</p>
   
 <h5>API Quota Usage charts are not returned at a license level with intervals in minutes</h5>
   <p>When a quota policy is attached to a license and the defined interval is in minutes, the API Analytics License page does not return charts for the API Quota Usage. The other charts on API Analytics License page return proper results.</p>  
   
 <h5>JRE upgrade resulted in a new error message regarding untrusted certificates</h5>
   <p>After upgrading the JRE shipped with the product from 2019.1.36 to 2020.2, the error message returned for untrusted certificates changed.  The new version of the JRE returns a socket error rather than an error specific to an untrusted certificate. This is not a change in Akana; rather, it is a change in the JRE version.</p>

 <h5>MongoDB data rollups</h5>
   <p>MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline support for data rollups was introduced in the 2022.1.0 release.
