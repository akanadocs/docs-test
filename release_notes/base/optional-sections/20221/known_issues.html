<h5>CloudHSM external keystore feature does not require an alias password</h5>
   <p>When performing key operations using CloudHSM, no alias password is required to perform key operations because the encrypted username and password are already passed when the container is started.</p>

   <p>The result is that any password provided as part of the payload is ignored, i.e., a wrong password would not cause the operation to fail.</p>
   
<h5>The Throughput Quota policy processes an extra request with the grid counter service</h5>
   <p>When the Throughout Quota policy is configured with a limit of x requests per time interval, the throughput limit exceeded error is returned for x + two requests instead of x + one request.</p>
   
 <h5>API Quota Usage charts are not returned at a license level with intervals in minutes</h5>
   <p>When a quota policy is attached to a license and the defined interval is in minutes, the API Analytics License page does not return charts for the API Quota Usage. The other charts on API Analytics License page return proper results.</p>  
   
 <h5>JRE upgrade resulted in a new error message regarding untrusted certificates</h5>
   <p>After upgrading the JRE shipped with the product from 2019.1.36 to 2020.2, the error message returned for untrusted certificates changed.  The new version of the JRE returns a socket error rather than an error specific to an untrusted certificate. This is not a change in Akana; rather, it is a change in the JRE version.</p>

    <h6><b>Case number</b>: 00847940</h6>   
 <h5>Container's Admin Console may report duplicate valid session cookie errors</h5>
   <p>The Admin Console of the container may intermittently display an error dialog reporting duplicate valid session cookies. The Admin Console may then become unresponsive or may return an an HTTP 404 error "File not found." Clearing browser cookies clears this error. </p>	
 <h5>Duplicate log entries for exceptions and JOSE Profile Policy</h5>
   <p>Any exception will result in two identical stack traces being written to the log file.</p>
   <p>Additionally, when the JOSE Profile Policy is used and Forced Diagnostic Logging is turned on, the trace block will be written twice and the second trace block will have an exception stack trace appended even when there is no exception.</p>
