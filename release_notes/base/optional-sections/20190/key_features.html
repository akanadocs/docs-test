<h4 id="201900-key-features">Key Features: 2019.0.0</h4>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The key features here are specific to 2019.0.0 and are not available in  earlier 2018.0.x update releases. For features and enhancements also available in 2019.0.0 but delivered in previous update releases, see each update version below.</p>
<h5>Support for OpenAPI 3.0 specification
</h5>
<p>The Developer Portal adds support for OpenAPI 3.0. OpenAPI 3.0, based on the original Swagger 2.0 specification, provides a standard, language-independent interface to RESTful APIs. Support includes an OAS Schema Form Editor, which is a graphical and text editor for authoring and editing        Open API Specification v3 documents. The editor supports syntax and semantic validation on        save or switch between text and graphical view, as well as code completion and syntax highlighting. The API Designer also supports dynamic switching between OAS 3.0 and Swagger 2.0. See <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/learnmore/apiadmin_a_d_d_oas30.htm">Open API  Specification 3.0 Support</a> for details.</p>

<h5>Model Library</h5>
<p>The new Model Library is a   centralized library of model objects in the context of a business on the  platform. Highlights include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>    The ability to reference Model Library objects from any APIs in the business, so that       APIs and API consumers can work with consistent data definitions across       all APIs</li>
  <li>Support for JSON Schema       Draft 4</li>
  <li>Support for importing existing models</li>
  <li>Support for inline       authoring of the model definition via the Schema Designer, which offers       two modes: a simple JSON text        editor and a form editor  </li>
  <li>The Business Admin's       full permission for the Model Library with two new roles: a Model Designer and a Model Administrator</li>
  <li>Support for multiple, valid versions of a       model object</li>
  <li>Addition of a new, customizable, governance workflow</li>
  <li>The ability to       group models into categories</li>
</ul>
<h5>Support for multiple authentication policies</h5>
<p>The platform supports  multiple authentication policies on a single API using the Aggregate Policy.  The Aggregate Policy includes a new &ldquo;Choose Policy Enforcement  Requirement&rdquo; page.&nbsp; Users can select either the logical <strong>OR</strong> (if the message  meets the requirements of any one of the policies included in the Aggregate  Policy, the request is successful) or <strong>AND</strong> (the request &nbsp;must meet the requirements of all policies included in the  Aggregate Policy, or it will fail). </p><p class="supID"><b>Support tickets: </b>SUPPORT-10638, SUPPORT-3244, SUPPORT-5785, SUPPORT-1110, SUP-16299</p>

<h5>Support for multiple OAuth domains for a single API</h5>
<p>An OAuth policy can authenticate and authorize requests against multiple, different providers. The API OAuth Details page in Community Manager now allows the assignment of  an OAuth provider to multiple endpoints, assuming that the Admin has configured  multiple OAuth providers. The provider used for messages to an API depends on  the scopes set up for each OAuth Provider. This support includes the addition of a new media type, <span class="code-inline">application/vnd.akana.v2019+json</span>, with the following API enhancements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="code-inline">PUT /apis/versions/{ApiVersionID}/oauthdetails</span> is overloaded by content-type</li>
  <li><span class="code-inline">GET /apis/versions/{ApiVersionID</span>} and <span class="code-inline">GET /apis/services</span> can produce the new content type, meaning that multiple OAuth providers are returned instead of the first found.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more detail, see <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/learnmore/api_admin_oauth_support.htm#api_oauth_config">How do I configure OAuth Details for my API?</a></p>
<h5>Enhanced support for Open Banking Version 3.1</h5>
<p>This release expands support for  the UK OpenBanking v3.1  standard via the JOSE Policy v2, which now verifies the certificate  subject DN in the &ldquo;<a href="http://openbanking.org.uk/iss" title="http://openbanking.org.uk/iss">http://openbanking.org.uk/iss</a>&rdquo;  header.</p>
