<h4 id="201910-key-features">Key Features: 2019.1.0</h4>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The key features here are speciic to 2019.1.0 and are not available in  earlier 2019.0.x update releases. For features and enhancements also available in 2019.1.0 but delivered in previous update releases, see each update version below.</p>

	
<h5 class="note">New Open Banking  Client Validation policy to support Open Banking MATLS</h5>
<p>A new validation policy has been added to support the Open Banking Mutual Authentication TLS (MATLS) specification. This policy, the Open Banking Client Validation Policy, uses MATLS rather than the client secret for authentication. This is required for the Open Banking Dynamic Client Registration for OAuth.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Supports validation of headers added by the load balancer</strong><br>
    For the UK Open Banking Client Validation Policy, the Network Director can now perform OAuth client authentication based on headers added by the load balancer, which routes incoming API requests to a load balancer cluster. The load balancer extracts details on client certification and adds them as headers, then routes the request to the Network Director.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Uses only certifications with &quot;use&quot; &quot; &quot;tls&quot;</strong><br>
    The UK Open Banking Client Validation Policy with MATLS support uses only certifications with "use" : "tls" from the OB JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) URL when validating the client certification.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="hermosa-theme">Hermosa theme UI header redesigned</h5>
<p>The Header for the Hermosa theme has been completely redesigned for improved look-and-feel and usability. Elements of the site are more easily accessible, with dropdown menus for the top-level items, among other improvements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that this change impacts header customizations, which will need to be ported to the new header. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/share/cm_customizing_ui.htm" rel="nofollow">http://docs.akana.com/cm/share/cm_customizing_ui.htm</a>.</p>

<h5>Test Client Enhancements</h5>
<p>Test Client has been enhanced to support multiple OAuth policies on a single API and the Aggregate policy.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Aggregate Policy<br>
 </strong> The Test Client now includes support for testing APIs with an attached Aggregate Policy that includes  policies supported by Test Client. Adding an Aggregate Policy to an API allows the API Admin to set up a scenario where multiple policies are combined into one. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/learnmore/api_admin_testing_tc.htm#tc_configsettings_aggregatepolicy" rel="nofollow">Test Client security settings: Aggregate Policy</a>&nbsp;on the Akana docs site.</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple OAuth policies</strong><br>
    If the API supports multiple OAuth providers, you can choose the provider you want to test against. See 
      <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/learnmore/api_admin_testing_tc.htm#tc_configsettings_oauthpolicy_multiple_oap">Test Client security settings: OAuth Policy: Multiple OAuth Provider</a>.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>The Charts page within API Analytics has new filters for viewing API and App transactions</h5>
<p>The Charts page within API Analytics now includes both charts and  logs combined, with filters for viewing both API and App transaction logs and  charts. For example, for a specific API, you can filter by all available  operations, statuses, and response time. To view transaction log data, use the Load Logs button.<br>
  <strong>Note</strong>: Log information is available only if an auditing policy was attached to  the API during the time period.</p>
