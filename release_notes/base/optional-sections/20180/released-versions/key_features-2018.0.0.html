    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The key features here are specific to 2018.0.0 and are not available in  earlier 8.4.x update releases. For features and enhancements also available in 2018.0.0 but delivered in previous update releases, see each update version below.</p>
    <h5>Server Name Indication (SNI)  support in  the developer portal</h5>
    <p>The developer portal now supports Server Name Indication (SNI) at the tenant level, for developer portal access. SNI is an extension of the TLS protocol that allows a single server to connect multiple SSL certificates to one IP address.Â Now, if you add your own security certificate, it's presented (by SNI) to your tenant accessing the developer portal. </p>

      Support for physical services in the developer portal
    </h5>
    <p>The developer portal now supports adding and managing a physical service. By default, APIs are created as proxies and hosted on the platform. An API added as a physical service is instead hosted externally, but is available to platform-hosted APIs. Because a physical service isn't hosted, many of the functions and activities associated with managing a proxied API aren't applicable. You can:    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modify the API design, including resources, model objects, tags, settings, and default media types.</li>
      <li>Modify the API description.</li>
      <li>Set up documentation for the physical service.</li>
      <li>Manage versions for the physical service.</li>
      <li>Set up and manage one or more endpoints for the physical service.</li>
      <li>Add, modify, or delete one or more policies associated with the physical service.</li>
      <li>Add or update certificates for the physical service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To use the physical service:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reference it in a script used by another API</li>
      <li>Reference it in a process used by another API</li>
      <li>Use it in defining orchestration for another API    </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Open Banking support</h5>
    <p>The platform now supports the (UK) <a href="https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/4011436/Payment+Initiation+API+Specification+-+v1.0.0">Open Banking specification</a> that mandates banks to provide an interface allowing third parties to access account information and perform authorized operations on behalf of the account holder. The platform also provides support for banks (ASPSPs) that seek to create a PSD2 dedicated interface that is implemented through APIs. (An ASPSP is any financial institution that offers a payment account with online access.)</p>
    <p>Support  of this standard is implemented  via a new option on the policy,  &quot;Enforce Open Banking&quot; available on the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) Security Policy v2. If checked, Open Banking rules are  enforced when the policy is attached to an API and the API is in use. <br>
    </p>
    <h5>Support for MongoDB 3.4 and 3.6</h5>
    <p>The API platform now supports MongoDB 3.4 and 3.6.</p>
    <h5>Support for PingFederate 9.0.x</h5>
    <p>The API platform now supports PingFederate 9.0.x.</p>
    <h5>Support for Elasticsearch 6.3.1</h5>
    <p>This release now supports Elasticsearch 6.3.1 including the two modes "Transport Client" and "Rest Client (High Level)". The platform no longer supports the Embedded Mode feature. Please see the documentation for setup and configuration.</p>

    <h5>Lifecycle Coordinator management enhancements    </h5>
    <p>Lifecycle Coordinator  which supports easy management of API lifecycle stages, is now a standalone interface to support easier setting up, configuring, and managing different development environments. The new UI is implemented via a new theme, DevOps, available in the developer portal at Admin | Settings | Site.</p>
    <p>Some new features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A new LC Admin (Requests) page for viewing and canceling all LC requests. This page is accessible only to Admins.</li>
      <li>A new LC User page that displays all requests for the promotion hierarchy and supports the approval/rejection of pending requests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For detail on these new features, see <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/learnmore/site_admin_lc.htm">Managing Lifecycle Coordinator</a> in the Akana documentation.</p>
