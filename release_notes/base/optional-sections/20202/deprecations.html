<h5 id="deprecate_dafault_theme">Default Theme is removed with 2020.2.0</h5>
	<p>Default Theme was deprecated in 2020.1.0 and has now been removed. All customers using Default Theme should move to the Hermosa Theme as soon as possible, and migrate any customizations. For example, port header customizations according to <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/customization/migration_guide.htm" target="_blank">Community Manager: Migration Guide</a> and <a href="https://docs.akana.com/cm/customization/cm_customizing_ui.htm" target="_blank">Community Manager: Customizing the User Interface</a>. Other customizations should continue to work, but style customizations are likely to be required.</p>
