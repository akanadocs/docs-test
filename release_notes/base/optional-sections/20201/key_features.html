<h4 id="202010-key-features">Key Features: 2020.1.0</h4>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The key features here are specific to 2020.1.0 and are not available in earlier 2019.1.x update releases. For features and enhancements also available in 2020.1.0 but delivered in previous 2019.1.x update releases, see each update version below.</p>
<h5>Envision Performance and UI enhancements</h5>
<p>Akana’s business analytics solution Envision has been relaunched with numerous enhancements and performance improvements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chart creation now provides UI tips to help the user make the appropriate decisions regarding the selection of rollup intervals and filters targeted at specific data.</li>
  <li>The UI features a progress bar while loading charts. </li>
  
  <li>Data set size has been reduced, which also improves  MongoDB server size requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deprecation</strong>: The &quot;Realtime&quot; chart time interval features has been disabled, as this information is available in the developer portal. Existing real time charts will continue to function.</p>
<h5>Support for Kafka for Analytics</h5>
<p>This release adds support for Apache Kafka, a deployment option that allows audit and metrics data from the Akana gateways to be streamed via Kafka instead of the native built-in support. The use of Kafka can improve Akana gateway performance and increase the deployed platform's reliability:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Improved performance</strong>: Offloading the processing of these messages to Kafka reduces the load on the Akana gateways and improves their performance. It also ensures guaranteed message delivery and prevents out-of-memory issues caused by very large message sizes and high transactional volumes. </li>
  <li><strong>Increased reliability</strong>: Using Kafka to process messages also increases the reliability of the deployed platform. It ensures that the Akana API Gateway and Policy Manager communication, essential to the health of the Akana platform, avoids any potential contention issues caused by overloading any of the Akana components. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Akana deployment can also specify the heap size to use for messages. The default is 20%. Any messages that would result in exceeding the specified heap size are dropped. This approach helps keep the gateways alive and performant.</p>
<h5>New API consumer-focused theme &quot;Bonita&quot;</h5>
<p> A new theme Bonita has a user-friendly, streamlined interface targeted at the API consumer, i.e., the app developer, and provides access to API information including the API overview, details, performance charts, logs, documentation, and Test Client. Similarly, for apps, Bonita users have access to the app's details, overview, performance charts, logs, license monitoring, and Test Client.  </p>
<p>Bonita is ideally suited to the production instance in the lifecycle in which APIs are promoted via automation. Automation ensures that only approved and governed APIs make it into production, thereby providing a trusted portal with no rogue APIs. For detail, see <a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/learnmore/basics_theme_bonita.htm" target="_blank">Bonita Theme</a> on the Akana docs site.</p>
<h5>API Charts enhancements</h5>
<h6>Operational metrics improvements </h6>
<p>The information reported and displayed in API transaction logs now includes several new metrics to provide additional information about the timing of exchange processing in the API Gateway. This allows for the measurement of timings such as TTFB (Time to First Byte), I/O times, and API Gateway processing times. These new metrics are used to provide enhanced feedback in the developer portal user interface for API analytics. See<a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/learnmore/apiadmin_monitoring.htm#api_logs_ttfb" target="_blank"> Viewing the time to first byte (TTFB) metric</a> on the Akana docs site.</p>
<h6>Monthly reports</h6>
<p>The developer portal now includes a monthly report that provides a visual summary of metric information across all businesses for the tenant. Data can be broken out by day if needed, and includes platform API usage, customer API usage, and totals for resources such as apps and APIs. See<a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/learnmore/bus_admin_org_root_monthly_report.htm" target="_blank"> Monthly Report</a> for detail.</p>
<h6>My Dashboard</h6>
<p>The developer portal now includes a new dashboard where users can monitor up to 10 APIs on which they have the API Admin role. Users can adjust the visual display as needed, including adjusting duration and interval for the chart and removing one or more APIs from the display. The My Dashboard feature includes charts for Throughput, Request Size, and Response Time. See<a href="http://docs.akana.com/cm/learnmore/apiadmin_mydashboard.htm" target="_blank"> Monitoring Top APIs with the My Dashboard Feature</a> on the Akana docs site.</p>
<h5>API documentation enhancements</h5>
<p>Multiple improvements have been made to the generated Swagger 2.0 API documentation  for improved usability, including converting the description from a column to a row, adding color for easy identification of the sample JSON, and improving readability by moving the operation summary and providing better spacing.</p>

<h5>Internationalization of error messages and UI copy </h5>
<p>The platform’s support of dynamic deployment of error messages and UI copy, introduced in 2019.1.12, has been enhanced to require specifying the resource bundle base name in the Java properties file. Generated documentation now includes a summary of resource bundles for UI copy and error messages. Specifying the resource bundle base name helps identify the resources in use, which helps reduce the likelihood of collisions and speeds up lookups. See<a href="http://docs.akana.com/ag/custom_development/error_message_internationalization.htm" target="_blank"> Internationalizing Error Messages and UI Copy</a> on the Akana docs site.</p>
<h5>MySQL 8.0 support </h5>
<p>Support has been added for MySQL 8.0. </p>
<p>Note that MySQL 8.0.x uses GROUPS as a reserved word, so the platform's table name GROUPS has been changed to CM_GROUPS.</p>
<h5>Enhancements to deployment automation</h5>
<p>This release includes numerous enhancements to the recipes that automate deployment. See<a href="#ATMO-33898"> Deployment Automation Improvements</a> for details.</p>
